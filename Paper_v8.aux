(A) In DLD1, we found that 5ng/ml of VEGFA increased NFATc1 and E-cadherin gene expression via qPCR and 50ng/ml potentiated this effect at 48 hrs. (B - C) These findings were confirmed at the protein level via immunofluorescence, as ecadherin levels and nuclear localization of NFATc1 increased. (D) Treatment with (10ng/ml) TGF$\beta $2 resulted in mesenchymal transformation as measured via qPCR against target genes Slug, ecadherin, vimentin, Sp1, and NFATc1. (E - F) Immunofluorescence and nuclear localization revealed a strong presence of phospho-Sp1. (G) Combination of VEGFA (50ng/ml) and TGF$\beta $2 (10ng/ml) treatment resulted in increased Slug, NFATc1, and vimentin expression, while also increasing ecadherin levels compared to control. (H) Immunofluorescence confirmed these results, as both ecadherin and vimentin levels were elevated. (I) A significant increase in nuclear localization of both NFATc1 and phospho-Sp1 were also found. Magnification, 40x. Scale bars: 50$\mu $m. C=Control, T=TGF$\beta $2 , V=VEGFA, VI=NFAT inhibitor (VIVIT).
