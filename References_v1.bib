	Abstract = {Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays an important role in embryonic development, tissue regeneration, and cancer metastasis. Whereas several feedback loops have been shown to regulate EMT, it remains elusive how they coordinately modulate EMT response to TGF-β treatment. We construct a mathematical model for the core regulatory network controlling TGF-β-induced EMT. Through deterministic analyses and stochastic simulations, we show that EMT is a sequential two-step program in which an epithelial cell first is converted to partial EMT then to the mesenchymal state, depending on the strength and duration of TGF-β stimulation. Mechanistically the system is governed by coupled reversible and irreversible bistable switches. The SNAIL1/miR-34 double-negative feedback loop is responsible for the reversible switch and regulates the initiation of EMT, whereas the ZEB/miR-200 feedback loop is accountable for the irreversible switch and controls the establishment of the mesenchymal state. Furthermore, an autocrine TGF-β/miR-200 feedback loop makes the second switch irreversible, modulating the maintenance of EMT. Such coupled bistable switches are robust to parameter variation and molecular noise. We provide a mechanistic explanation on multiple experimental observations. The model makes several explicit predictions on hysteretic dynamic behaviors, system response to pulsed stimulation, and various perturbations, which can be straightforwardly tested.},

@article{Hong:2015aa,
	Abstract = {Reversible epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is central to tissue development, epithelial stemness, and cancer metastasis. While many regulatory elements have been identified to induce EMT, the complex process underlying such cellular plasticity remains poorly understood. Utilizing a systems biology approach integrating modeling and experiments, we found multiple intermediate states contributing to EMT and that the robustness of the transitions is modulated by transcriptional factor Ovol2. In particular, we obtained evidence for a mutual inhibition relationship between Ovol2 and EMT inducer Zeb1, and observed that adding this regulation generates a novel four-state system consisting of two distinct intermediate phenotypes that differ in differentiation propensities and are favored in different environmental conditions. We identified epithelial cells that naturally exist in an intermediate state with bidirectional differentiation potential, and found the balance between EMT-promoting and -inhibiting factors to be critical in achieving and selecting between intermediate states. Our analysis suggests a new design principle in controlling cellular plasticity through multiple intermediate cell fates and underscores the critical involvement of Ovol2 and its associated molecular regulations.},

@article{Zhang:2014aa,
	Abstract = {The process of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an essential type of cellular plasticity associated with a change from epithelial cells that function as a barrier consisting of a sheet of tightly connected cells to cells with properties of mesenchyme that are not attached to their neighbors and are highly motile. This phenotypic change occurs during development and also contributes to pathological processes, such as cancer progression. The molecular mechanisms controlling the switch between the fully epithelial and fully mesenchymal phenotypes and cells that have characteristics of both (partial EMT) are controversial, and multiple theoretical models have been proposed. To test these theoretical models, we systematically measured the changes in the abundance of proteins, mRNAs, and microRNAs (miRNAs) that represent the core regulators of EMT induced by transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) in the human breast epithelial cell line MCF10A at the population and single-cell levels. We provide experimental confirmation for a model of cascading switches in phenotypes associated with TGF-β1-induced EMT of MCF10A cells that involves two double-negative feedback loops: one between the transcription factor SNAIL1 and the miR-34 family and another between the transcription factor ZEB1 and the miR-200 family. Furthermore, our data showed that whereas the transition from epithelial to partial EMT was reversible for MCF10A cells, the transition from partial EMT to mesenchymal was mostly irreversible at high concentrations of TGF-β1.},

@article{Liu:2008aa,
	Abstract = {Overexpression of zinc finger E-box binding homeobox transcription factor 1 (Zeb1) in cancer leads to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and increased metastasis. As opposed to overexpression, we show that mutation of Zeb1 in mice causes a mesenchymal-epithelial transition in gene expression characterized by ectopic expression of epithelial genes such as E-cadherin and loss of expression of mesenchymal genes such as vimentin. In contrast to rapid proliferation in cancer cells where Zeb1 is overexpressed, this mesenchymal-epithelial transition in mutant mice is associated with diminished proliferation of progenitor cells at sites of developmental defects, including the forming palate, skeleton and CNS. Zeb1 dosage-dependent deregulation of epithelial and mesenchymal genes extends to mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), and mutant MEFs also display diminished replicative capacity in culture, leading to premature senescence. Replicative senescence in MEFs is classically triggered by products of the Ink4a (Cdkn2a) gene. However, this Ink4a pathway is not activated during senescence of Zeb1 mutant MEFs. Instead, there is ectopic expression of two other cell cycle inhibitory cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, p15Ink4b (Cdkn2b) and p21Cdkn1a (Cdkn1a). We demonstrate that this ectopic expression of p15Ink4b extends in vivo to sites of diminished progenitor cell proliferation and developmental defects in Zeb1-null mice.},

@article{Steinway:2014aa,
	Abstract = {Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a developmental process hijacked by cancer cells to leave the primary tumor site, invade surrounding tissue, and establish distant metastases. A hallmark of EMT is the loss of E-cadherin expression, and one major signal for the induction of EMT is TGFβ, which is dysregulated in up to 40% of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We have constructed an EMT network of 70 nodes and 135 edges by integrating the signaling pathways involved in developmental EMT and known dysregulations in invasive HCC. We then used discrete dynamic modeling to understand the dynamics of the EMT network driven by TGFβ. Our network model recapitulates known dysregulations during the induction of EMT and predicts the activation of the Wnt and Sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathways during this process. We show, across multiple murine (P2E and P2M) and human HCC cell lines (Huh7, PLC/PRF/5, HLE, and HLF), that the TGFβ signaling axis is a conserved driver of mesenchymal phenotype HCC and confirm that Wnt and SHH signaling are induced in these cell lines. Furthermore, we identify by network analysis eight regulatory feedback motifs that stabilize the EMT process and show that these motifs involve cross-talk among multiple major pathways. Our model will be useful in identifying potential therapeutic targets for the suppression of EMT, invasion, and metastasis in HCC.},

@article{Lu:2013aa,
	Abstract = {Forward and backward transitions between epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes play crucial roles in embryonic development and tissue repair. Aberrantly regulated transitions are also a hallmark of cancer metastasis. The genetic network that regulates these transitions appears to allow for the existence of a hybrid phenotype (epithelial/mesenchymal). Hybrid cells are endowed with mixed epithelial and mesenchymal characteristics, enabling specialized capabilities such as collective cell migration. Cell-fate determination between the three phenotypes is in fact regulated by a circuit composed of two highly interconnected chimeric modules--the miR-34/SNAIL and the miR-200/ZEB mutual-inhibition feedback circuits. Here, we used detailed modeling of microRNA-based regulation to study this core unit. More specifically, we investigated the functions of the two isolated modules and subsequently of the combined unit when the two modules are integrated into the full regulatory circuit. We found that miR-200/ZEB forms a tristable circuit that acts as a ternary switch, driven by miR-34/SNAIL, that is a monostable module that acts as a noise-buffering integrator of internal and external signals. We propose to associate the three stable states--(1,0), (high miR-200)/(low ZEB); (0,1), (low miR-200)/(high ZEB); and (1/2,1/2), (medium miR-200)/(medium ZEB)--with the epithelial, mesenchymal, and hybrid phenotypes, respectively. Our (1/2,1/2) state hypothesis is consistent with recent experimental studies (e.g., ZEB expression measurements in collectively migrating cells) and explains the lack of observed mesenchymal-to-hybrid transitions in metastatic cells and in induced pluripotent stem cells. Testable predictions of dynamic gene expression during complete and partial transitions are presented.},

@article{Hu:2015aa,
	Abstract = {RNA genetic circuitry is emerging as a powerful tool to control gene expression. However, little work has been done to create a theoretical foundation for RNA circuit design. A prerequisite to this is a quantitative modeling framework that accurately describes the dynamics of RNA circuits. In this work, we develop an ordinary differential equation model of transcriptional RNA genetic circuitry, using an RNA cascade as a test case. We show that parameter sensitivity analysis can be used to design a set of four simple experiments that can be performed in parallel using rapid cell-free transcription-translation (TX-TL) reactions to determine the 13 parameters of the model. The resulting model accurately recapitulates the dynamic behavior of the cascade, and can be easily extended to predict the function of new cascade variants that utilize new elements with limited additional characterization experiments. Interestingly, we show that inconsistencies between model predictions and experiments led to the model-guided discovery of a previously unknown maturation step required for RNA regulator function. We also determine circuit parameters in two different batches of TX-TL, and show that batch-to-batch variation can be attributed to differences in parameters that are directly related to the concentrations of core gene expression machinery. We anticipate the RNA circuit models developed here will inform the creation of computer aided genetic circuit design tools that can incorporate the growing number of RNA regulators, and that the parametrization method will find use in determining functional parameters of a broad array of natural and synthetic regulatory systems.},

@article{Suehiro:2014aa,
	Abstract = {VEGF is a key regulator of endothelial cell migration, proliferation, and inflammation, which leads to activation of several signaling cascades, including the calcineurin-nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) pathway. NFAT is not only important for immune responses but also for cardiovascular development and the pathogenesis of Down syndrome. By using Down syndrome model mice and clinical patient samples, we showed recently that the VEGF-calcineurin-NFAT signaling axis regulates tumor angiogenesis and tumor metastasis. However, the connection between genome-wide views of NFAT-mediated gene regulation and downstream gene function in the endothelium has not been studied extensively. Here we performed comprehensive mapping of genome-wide NFATc1 binding in VEGF-stimulated primary cultured endothelial cells and elucidated the functional consequences of VEGF-NFATc1-mediated phenotypic changes. A comparison of the NFATc1 ChIP sequence profile and epigenetic histone marks revealed that predominant NFATc1-occupied peaks overlapped with promoter-associated histone marks. Moreover, we identified two novel NFATc1 regulated genes, CXCR7 and RND1. CXCR7 knockdown abrogated SDF-1- and VEGF-mediated cell migration and tube formation. siRNA treatment of RND1 impaired vascular barrier function, caused RhoA hyperactivation, and further stimulated VEGF-mediated vascular outgrowth from aortic rings. Taken together, these findings suggest that dynamic NFATc1 binding to target genes is critical for VEGF-mediated endothelial cell activation. CXCR7 and RND1 are NFATc1 target genes with multiple functions, including regulation of cell migration, tube formation, and barrier formation in endothelial cells.},

	Abstract = {Ensemble modeling is a well established approach for obtaining robust predictions and for simulating course grained population behavior in deterministic mathematical models. In this study, we present a multiobjective based technique to estimate model ensembles, the Pareto Optimal Ensemble Technique in the Julia programming language (JuPOETs). JuPOETs integrates simulated annealing with Pareto optimality to estimate parameter ensembles on or near the optimal tradeoff surface between competing training objectives. We demonstrated JuPOETs on a suite of multiobjective problems, including test functions with parameter bounds and system constraints as well as for the identification of a proof-of-concept biochemical model with four conflicting training objectives. JuPOETs identified optimal or near optimal solutions approximately six-fold faster than a corresponding implementation in Octave for the suite of test functions. For the proof-of-concept biochemical model, JuPOETs produced an ensemble of parameters that gave both the mean of the training data for conflicting data sets, while simultaneously estimating parameter sets that performed well on each of the individual objective functions. JuPOETs can be adapted to solve many problem types, including mixed binary and continuous variable types, bilevel optimization problems and constrained problems without altering the base algorithm. JuPOETs can be installed using the Julia package manager from the JuPOETs GitHub repository at https://github.com/varnerlab/POETs.jl.},

@article{pr3010178,
	Abstract = {In this study, we present a novel modeling approach which combines ordinary differential equation (ODE) modeling with logical rules to simulate an archetype biochemical network, the human coagulation cascade. The model consisted of five differential equations augmented with several logical rules describing regulatory connections between model components, and unmodeled interactions in the network. This formulation was more than an order of magnitude smaller than current coagulation models, because many of the mechanistic details of coagulation were encoded as logical rules. We estimated an ensemble of likely model parameters (N = 20) from in vitro extrinsic coagulation data sets, with and without inhibitors, by minimizing the residual between model simulations and experimental measurements using particle swarm optimization (PSO). Each parameter set in our ensemble corresponded to a unique particle in the PSO. We then validated the model ensemble using thrombin data sets that were not used during training. The ensemble predicted thrombin trajectories for conditions not used for model training, including thrombin generation for normal and hemophilic coagulation in the presence of platelets (a significant unmodeled component). We then used flux analysis to understand how the network operated in a variety of conditions, and global sensitivity analysis to identify which parameters controlled the performance of the network. Taken together, the hybrid approach produced a surprisingly predictive model given its small size, suggesting the proposed framework could also be used to dynamically model other biochemical networks, including intracellular metabolic networks, gene expression programs or potentially even cell free metabolic systems.},

	Abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small highly conserved RNAs that provide widespread expressional control through the translational repression of mRNA. MiRNAs have fundamental roles in the regulation of intracellular processes, and their importance during malignant transformation and metastasis is becoming increasingly well recognized. An important event in the metastatic cascade is epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), a reversible phenotypic switch over, which endows malignant epithelial cells with the capacity to break free from one another and invade the surrounding stroma. Our understanding of EMT has been significantly improved by the characterization of miRNAs that influence the signalling pathways and downstream events that define EMT on a molecular level. Here, we detail the role of miRNAs in EMT, and in doing so demonstrate their importance in the early stages of the metastatic cascade; we discuss a significant body of data that suggest new opportunities for drug development, and we highlight critical knowledge gaps that remain to be addressed.},

@article{Butcher:2004aa,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The influence of mechanical forces on cell function has been well documented for many different cell types. Endothelial cells native to the aortic valve may play an important role in mediating tissue responses to the complex fluid environment, and may therefore respond to fluid flow in a different manner than more characterized vascular endothelial cells.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Porcine endothelial cells of aortic and aortic valvular origin were subjected to 20 dynes/cm2 steady laminar shear stress for up to 48 hours, with static cultures serving as controls. The aortic valve endothelial cells were observed to align perpendicular to flow, in direct contrast to the aortic endothelial cells, which aligned parallel to flow. Focal adhesion complexes reorganized prominently at the ends of the long axis of aligned cells. Valvular endothelial cell alignment was dependent on Rho-kinase signaling, whereas vascular endothelial cell alignment was dependent on both Rho-kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signal pathways.
CONCLUSIONS: These differences in response to mechanical forces suggest a unique phenotype of valvular endothelial cells not mimicked by vascular endothelial cells, and could have implications for cardiovascular cell biology and cell-source considerations for tissue-engineered valvular substitutes.},

	Abstract = {The contribution of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions (EMT) in both developmental and pathological conditions has been widely recognized and studied. In a parallel process, governed by a similar set of signaling and transcription factors, endothelial-to-mesenchymal transitions (EndoMT) contribute to heart valve formation and the generation of cancer-associated fibroblasts. During angiogenic sprouting, endothelial cells express many of the same genes and break down basement membrane; however, they retain intercellular junctions and migrate as a connected train of cells rather than as individual cells. This has been termed a partial endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition. A key regulatory check-point determines whether cells undergo a full or a partial epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions/endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition; however, very little is known about how this switch is controlled. Here we discuss these developmental/pathological pathways, with a particular focus on their role in vascular biology.},

	Abstract = {The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor AP4/TFAP4/AP-4 is encoded by a c-MYC target gene and displays up-regulation concomitantly with c-MYC in colorectal cancer (CRC) and numerous other tumor types. Here a genome-wide characterization of AP4 DNA binding and mRNA expression was performed using a combination of microarray, genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation, next-generation sequencing, and bioinformatic analyses. Thereby, hundreds of induced and repressed AP4 target genes were identified. Besides many genes involved in the control of proliferation, the AP4 target genes included markers of stemness (LGR5 and CD44) and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) such as SNAIL, E-cadherin/CDH1, OCLN, VIM, FN1, and the Claudins 1, 4, and 7. Accordingly, activation of AP4 induced EMT and enhanced migration and invasion of CRC cells. Conversely, down-regulation of AP4 resulted in mesenchymal-epithelial transition and inhibited migration and invasion. In addition, AP4 induction was required for EMT, migration, and invasion caused by ectopic expression of c-MYC. Inhibition of AP4 in CRC cells resulted in decreased lung metastasis in mice. Elevated AP4 expression in primary CRC significantly correlated with liver metastasis and poor patient survival. These findings imply AP4 as a new regulator of EMT that contributes to metastatic processes in CRC and presumably other carcinomas.},

@article{Guaita:2002aa,
	Abstract = {E-cadherin protein plays a key role in the establishment and maintenance of adherent junctions. Recent evidence implicates the transcription factor Snail in the blockage of E-cadherin expression in fibroblasts and some epithelial tumor cells through direct binding to three E-boxes in the E-cadherin promoter. Transfection of Snail into epithelial cells leads to a more fibroblastic phenotype. Cells expressing Snail presented a scattered flattened phenotype with low intercellular contacts. Other epithelial markers like Cytokeratin 18 or MUC1 were also repressed. The effects of Snail on MUC1 transcription were mediated by two E-boxes present in the proximal promoter. Snail also induced expression of the mesenchymal markers fibronectin and LEF1 and the transcription repressor ZEB1. ZEB1 and Snail had a similar pattern of expression in epithelial cell lines, and both were induced by overexpression of ILK1, a kinase that causes the loss of E-cadherin and the acquisition of a fibroblastic phenotype. Snail overexpression in several cell lines raised ZEB1 RNA levels and increased the activity of ZEB1 promoter. ZEB1 could also repress E-cadherin and MUC1 promoters but less strongly than Snail. However, since ZEB1 expression persisted after Snail was down-regulated, ZEB1 may regulate epithelial genes in several tumor cell lines.},

	Abstract = {Snail/Slug family proteins have been identified in diverse species of both vertebrates and invertebrates. The proteins contain four to six zinc fingers and function as DNA-binding transcriptional regulators. Various members of the family have been demonstrated to regulate cell movement, neural cell fate, left-right asymmetry, cell cycle, and apoptosis. However, the molecular mechanisms of how these regulators function and the target genes involved are largely unknown. In this report, we demonstrate that human Slug (hSlug) is a repressor and modulates both activator-dependent and basal transcription. The repression depends on the C-terminal DNA-binding zinc fingers and on a separable repression domain located in the N terminus. This domain may recruit histone deacetylases to modify the chromatin and effect repression. Protein localization study demonstrates that hSlug is present in discrete foci in the nucleus. This subnuclear pattern does not colocalize with the PML foci or the coiled bodies. Instead, the hSlug foci overlap extensively with areas of the SC-35 staining, some of which have been suggested to be sites of active splicing or transcription. These results lead us to postulate that hSlug localizes to target promoters, where activation occurs, to repress basal and activator-mediated transcription.},

	Abstract = {The existence of homologous genes in diverse species is intriguing. A detailed comparison of the structure and function of gene families may provide important insights into gene regulation and evolution. An unproven assumption is that homologous genes have a common ancestor. During evolution, the original function of the ancestral gene might be retained in the different species which evolved along separate courses. In addition, new functions could have developed as the sequence began to diverge. This may also explain partly the presence of multipurpose genes, which have multiple functions at different stages of development and in different tissues. The Drosophila gene snail is a multipurpose gene; it has been demonstrated that snail is critical for mesoderm formation, for CNS development, and for wing cell fate determination. The related vertebrate Snail and Slug genes have also been proposed to participate in mesoderm formation, neural crest cell migration, carcinogenesis, and apoptosis. In this review, we will discuss the Snail/Slug family of regulators in species ranging from insect to human. We will present the protein structures, expression patterns, and functions based on molecular genetic analyses. We will also include the studies that helped to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of repression and the relationship between the conserved and divergent functions of these genes. Moreover, the studies may enable us to trace the evolution of this gene family.},

	Abstract = {The transcriptional repressors Snail and Slug are situated at the core of several signaling pathways proposed to mediate epithelial to mesenchymal transition or EMT, which has been implicated in tumor metastasis. EMT involves an alteration from an organized, epithelial cell structure to a mesenchymal, invasive and migratory phenotype. In order to obtain a global view of the impact of Snail and Slug expression, we performed a microarray experiment using the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line, which does not express detectable levels of Snail or Slug. MCF-7 cells were infected with Snail, Slug or control adenovirus, and RNA samples isolated at various time points were analyzed across all transcripts. Our analyses indicated that Snail and Slug regulate many genes in common, but also have distinct sets of gene targets. Gene set enrichment analyses indicated that Snail and Slug directed the transcriptome of MCF-7 cells from a luminal towards a more complex pattern that includes many features of the claudin-low breast cancer signature. Of particular interest, genes involved in the TGF-beta signaling pathway are upregulated, while genes responsible for a differentiated morphology are downregulated following Snail or Slug expression. Further we noticed increased histone acetylation at the promoter region of the transforming growth factor beta-receptor II (TGFBR2) gene following Snail or Slug expression. Inhibition of the TGF-beta signaling pathway using selective small-molecule inhibitors following Snail or Slug addition resulted in decreased cell migration with no impact on the repression of cell junction molecules by Snail and Slug. We propose that there are two regulatory modules embedded within EMT: one that involves repression of cell junction molecules, and the other involving cell migration via TGF-beta and/or other pathways.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Model development is a key task in systems biology, which typically starts from an initial model candidate and, involving an iterative cycle of hypotheses-driven model modifications, leads to new experimentation and subsequent model identification steps. The final product of this cycle is a satisfactory refined model of the biological phenomena under study. During such iterative model development, researchers frequently propose a set of model candidates from which the best alternative must be selected. Here we consider this problem of model selection and formulate it as a simultaneous model selection and parameter identification problem. More precisely, we consider a general mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) formulation for model selection and identification, with emphasis on dynamic models consisting of sets of either ODEs (ordinary differential equations) or DAEs (differential algebraic equations).
RESULTS: We solved the MINLP formulation for model selection and identification using an algorithm based on Scatter Search (SS). We illustrate the capabilities and efficiency of the proposed strategy with a case study considering the KdpD/KdpE system regulating potassium homeostasis in Escherichia coli. The proposed approach resulted in a final model that presents a better fit to the in silico generated experimental data.
CONCLUSIONS: The presented MINLP-based optimization approach for nested-model selection and identification is a powerful methodology for model development in systems biology. This strategy can be used to perform model selection and parameter estimation in one single step, thus greatly reducing the number of experiments and computations of traditional modeling approaches.},

	Abstract = {Here we address the problem of parameter estimation (inverse problem) of nonlinear dynamic biochemical pathways. This problem is stated as a nonlinear programming (NLP) problem subject to nonlinear differential-algebraic constraints. These problems are known to be frequently ill-conditioned and multimodal. Thus, traditional (gradient-based) local optimization methods fail to arrive at satisfactory solutions. To surmount this limitation, the use of several state-of-the-art deterministic and stochastic global optimization methods is explored. A case study considering the estimation of 36 parameters of a nonlinear biochemical dynamic model is taken as a benchmark. Only a certain type of stochastic algorithm, evolution strategies (ES), is able to solve this problem successfully. Although these stochastic methods cannot guarantee global optimality with certainty, their robustness, plus the fact that in inverse problems they have a known lower bound for the cost function, make them the best available candidates.},

@article{Jiang:2007aa,
	Abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an important process in tumor development, and several studies suggest that the Wnt/beta-catenin signal pathway may play an important role in EMT. However, there is no direct evidence showing that the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway actually determines the EMT induced by an exogenous signal. Our previous research has successfully proved that overexpression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) could induce EMT in LNCaP cells, but not in PC-3. The present study aims to determine whether the signal of HIF-1alpha for inducing prostate cancer cells to undergo EMT might possibly pass through the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway.
METHODS: Epithelial-mesenchymal transition associated proteins were detected in several human prostate carcinoma cell lines by Western blot, and then we distinguished the EMT positive cell lines from the EMT negative cell lines. Furthermore, we evaluated the possible correlation between potency of invasiveness and proliferation among these cell lines with different characteristics of EMT using Matrigel transwell and thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays. Finally, the different expression of some critical proteins and genes in Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway were analyzed by Western blot and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in these cells with different characteristics of EMT.
RESULTS: Among several prostate cancer cell lines, PC-3, LNCaP and PC-3/HIF-1alpha are EMT negative cell lines, whereas LNCaP/HIF-1alpha and IA8 have undergone the EMT process. EMT positive cells (LNCaP/HIF-1alpha and IA8) exhibit much stronger potency of invasiveness and proliferation than those of PC-3 and LNCaP, which belong to EMT negative cells. Interestingly, although PC-3/HIF-1alpha had not completed the EMT process, it still displayed stronger potency of invasion and proliferation, resembling EMT positive cells. The protein expression level of total glycogensynthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3beta) and phospho-GSK-3beta in LNCaP/HIF-1alpha, IA8 and PC-3/HIF-1alpha cells significantly decreased; however, the relative ratios of p-GSK3beta/t-GSK3beta in LNCaP/HIF-1alpha, IA8 and PC-3/HIF-1alpha cells were significantly higher than PC-3 and LNCaP. Consistently, beta-catenin protein expression increased in LNCaP/HIF-1alpha and IA8 cells, but not in PC-3/HIF-1alpha; RT-PCR confirmed these results, except for the enhanced transcription activity of beta-catenin mRNA in PC-3/HIF-1alpha.
CONCLUSION: Our data suggests that activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway correlates with the characteristic of EMT and potency of invasiveness and proliferation. This may be the critical factor that directly controls the process of EMT induced by HIF-1alpha in prostate cancer cells.},

	Abstract = {Activation of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases via cognate Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF)-like peptide ligands constitutes a major group of related signaling pathways that control proliferation, survival, angiogenesis and metastasis of breast cancer. In this respect, clinical trials with various ErbB receptor blocking antibodies and specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors have proven to be partially efficacious in the treatment of this heterogeneous disease. Induction of an embryonic program of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in breast cancer, whereupon epithelial tumor cells convert to a more mesenchymal-like phenotype, facilitates the migration, intravasation, and extravasation of tumor cells during metastasis. Breast cancers which exhibit properties of EMT are highly aggressive and resistant to therapy. Activation of ErbB signaling can regulate EMT-associated invasion and migration in normal and malignant mammary epithelial cells, as well as modulating discrete stages of mammary gland development. The purpose of this review is to summarize current information regarding the role of ErbB signaling in aspects of EMT that influence epithelial cell plasticity during mammary gland development and tumorigenesis. How this information may contribute to the improvement of therapeutic approaches in breast cancer will also be addressed.},

	Abstract = {The transcription factor NF-kappaB is activated in a range of human cancers and is thought to promote tumorigenesis, mainly due to its ability to protect transformed cells from apoptosis. To investigate the role of NF-kappaB in epithelial plasticity and metastasis, we utilized a well-characterized in vitro/in vivo model of mammary carcinogenesis that depends on the collaboration of the Ha-Ras oncoprotein and TGF-beta. We show here that the IKK-2/IkappaBalpha/NF-kappaB pathway is required for the induction and maintenance of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Inhibition of NF-kappaB signaling prevented EMT in Ras-transformed epithelial cells, while activation of this pathway promoted the transition to a mesenchymal phenotype even in the absence of TGF-beta. Furthermore, inhibition of NF-kappaB activity in mesenchymal cells caused a reversal of EMT, suggesting that NF-kappaB is essential for both the induction and maintenance of EMT. In line with the importance of EMT for invasion, blocking of NF-kappaB activity abrogated the metastatic potential of mammary epithelial cells in a mouse model system. Collectively, these data provide evidence of an essential role for NF-kappaB during distinct steps of breast cancer progression and suggest that the cooperation of Ras- and TGF-beta-dependent signaling pathways in late-stage tumorigenesis depends critically on NF-kappaB activity.},

	can act to promote tumour progression in the late stages of carcinogenesis.
	The mechanism by which this occurs is unknown although a ligand-induced
	epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is thought to be important.
	In this study, we demonstrate that active Ras is required for TGF-beta1-induced
	EMT in human keratinocytes and that epidermal growth factor (EGF)
	can substitute for mutant Ras. EMT was reversed by the removal of
	TGF-beta1. Under conditions of TGF-beta1-induced EMT, cells were

	normal Ras, TGF-beta1-activated ERK and p38 mitogen-activated protein
	kinases (MAPKs), and levels of activation were further increased
	by co-treatment with EGF. Inhibition of MAPK pathways and Smad2/3
	signalling blocked the induction of EMT by TGF-beta1. Further, inhibition
	of the AP-1 transcriptional complex by [6]-Gingerol, or by the ectopic
	expression of JDP2, blocked TGF-beta1-induced EMT and conversely,
	stimulation of AP-1 by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA)

	an effect that was attenuated by the inhibition of MAPKs and AP-1.
	The results demonstrate that active Ras and TGF-beta1 co-operate

	TEMT in vitro.The normal rat kidney tubular epithelial cell line
	(NRK52E) was cultured for six days on plastic or collagen type I-coated
	plates in the presence or absence of recombinant transforming growth
	factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1). Transdifferentiation of tubular cells into
	myofibroblasts was assessed by electron microscopy and by expression
	of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) and E-cadherin.NRK52E cells
	cultured on plastic or collagen-coated plates showed a classic cobblestone
	morphology. Culture in 1 ng/ml TGF-beta caused only very minor changes
	in morphology, but culture in 10 or 50 ng/ml TGF-beta1 caused profound
	changes. This involved hypertrophy, a loss of apical-basal polarity
	and microvilli, with cells becoming elongated and invasive, the formation
	of a new front-end back-end polarity, and the appearance of actin
	microfilaments and dense bodies. These morphological changes were
	accompanied by phenotypic changes. Double immunohistochemistry staining
	showed that the addition of TGF-beta1 to confluent cell cultures
	caused a loss of the epithelial marker E-cadherin and de novo expression
	of alpha-SMA. An intermediate stage in transdifferentiation could
	be seen with hypertrophic cells expressing both E-cadherin and alpha-SMA.
	De novo alpha-SMA expression was confirmed by Northern blotting,
	Western blotting, and flow cytometry. In particular, cells with a
	transformed morphology showed strong alpha-SMA immunostaining of
	characteristic microfilament structures along the cell axis. There
	was a dose-dependent increase in the percentage of cells expressing
	alpha-SMA with increasing concentrations of TGF-beta1, which was
	completely inhibited by the addition of a neutralizing anti-TGF-beta1
	antibody. Compared with growth on plastic, cell culture on collagen-coated
	plates showed a threefold increase in the percentage of cells expressing
	alpha-SMA in response to TGF-beta1.TGF-beta1 is a key mediator that
	regulates, in a dose-dependent fashion, transdifferentiation of tubular
	epithelial cells into alpha-SMA+ myofibroblasts. This transdifferentiation
	is markedly enhanced by growth on collagen type I. These findings
	have identified a novel pathway that may contribute to renal fibrosis
	associated with overexpression of TGF-beta1 within the diseased kidney.},

	Abstract = {The role of Wnt signaling in embryonic development and stem cell maintenance
	is well established and aberrations leading to the constitutive up-regulation
	of this pathway are frequent in several types of human cancers. Upon
	ligand-mediated activation, Wnt receptors promote the stabilization
	of ?-catenin, which translocates to the nucleus and binds to the
	T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) family of transcription
	factors to regulate the expression of Wnt target genes. When not
	bound to ?-catenin, the TCF/LEF proteins are believed to act as transcriptional
	repressors. Using a specific lentiviral reporter, we identified hematopoietic
	tumor cells displaying constitutive TCF/LEF transcriptional activation
	in the absence of ?-catenin stabilization. Suppression of TCF/LEF
	activity in these cells mediated by an inducible dominant-negative
	TCF4 (DN-TCF4) inhibited both cell growth and the expression of Wnt
	target genes. Further, expression of TCF1 and LEF1, but not TCF4,
	stimulated TCF/LEF reporter activity in certain human cell lines
	independently of ?-catenin. By a complementary approach in vivo,
	TCF1 mutants, which lacked the ability to bind to ?-catenin, induced
	Xenopus embryo axis duplication, a hallmark of Wnt activation, and
	the expression of the Wnt target gene Xnr3. Through generation of
	different TCF1-TCF4 fusion proteins, we identified three distinct
	TCF1 domains that participate in the ?-catenin-independent activity
	of this transcription factor. TCF1 and LEF1 physically interacted
	and functionally synergized with members of the activating transcription
	factor 2 (ATF2) family of transcription factors. Moreover, knockdown
	of ATF2 expression in lymphoma cells phenocopied the inhibitory effects
	of DN-TCF4 on the expression of target genes associated with the
	Wnt pathway and on cell growth. Together, our findings indicate that,
	through interaction with ATF2 factors, TCF1/LEF1 promote the growth
	of hematopoietic malignancies in the absence of ?-catenin stabilization,
	thus establishing a new mechanism for TCF1/LEF1 transcriptional activity
	distinct from that associated with canonical Wnt signaling.},

	Abstract = {Spindle-shaped myofibroblast-like cells, which contain alpha-smooth
	muscle actin, have been described in anterior subcapsular cataract
	and after-cataract. In a previous study in this laboratory, it was
	shown that transforming growth factor-beta (TGF beta) induces the
	formation of spindle-shaped cells in lens epithelial explants. The
	aim of this investigation was to determine whether these TGF beta-induced
	spindle-shaped cells contain alpha-smooth muscle actin. Lens epithelial
	explants were prepared from 21-day-old rats and cultured with either
	TGF beta 1 or basic FGF alone, a combination of both growth factors,
	or without added growth factors. After three days, cellular changes
	were monitored by phase contrast microscopy, localisation of filamentous
	actin with rhodamine-phalloidin, and immunolocalisation and immunoblotting
	of alpha-smooth muscle actin. TGF beta induced rapid cell elongation
	and formation of characteristic spindle-shaped cells in lens epithelial
	explants in the presence or absence of FGF. These cells contained
	alpha-smooth muscle actin, a marker for myofibroblastic cells and
	a protein not normally found in the lens. The present study thus
	provides molecular evidence that TGF beta induces cataractous changes
	in lens epithelial cells. As TGF beta is potentially available to
	lens cells in situ throughout life, these findings are consistent
	with a key role for TGF beta in the aetiology of major forms of subcapsular
	cataract.},

	Abstract = {Transition from a sessile epithelial phenotype to a migrating mesenchymal phenotype is a crucial step in transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)-induced pancreatic cancer cell migration and invasion. These profound morphologic and functional alterations are associated with characteristic changes in TGF-beta-regulated gene expression, defined by rapid repression of epithelial markers and a strong and sustained transcriptional induction of mesenchymal markers such as the intermediate filament vimentin. In this study, we have analyzed the role of the transcription factor Sp1 in TGF-beta-induced and Smad-mediated gene regulation during epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and migration of pancreatic cancer cells. Here, we show that Sp1 is required for TGF-beta-induced EMT, and that this function is especially mediated through transcriptional induction of vimentin. Our results emphasize the functional relevance of vimentin in TGF-beta-induced EMT because prevention of its induction strongly reduces cell migration. Altogether, this study helps to better understand the role of Sp1 in TGF-beta-induced progression of pancreatic cancer. It suggests that Sp1, via transcriptional induction of vimentin, cooperates with activated Smad complexes in mesenchymal transition and migration of pancreatic cancer cells upon TGF-beta stimulation.},

	However, the cellular origins of these mesenchymal phenotypes remain
	unclear. We examined whether the potent fibrogenic cytokine TGF-beta1
	could induce epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) in the human
	alveolar epithelial cell line, A549, and investigated the signaling
	pathway of TGF-beta1-mediated EMT.A549 cells were examined for evidence
	of EMT after treatment with TGF-beta1. EMT was assessed by: morphology
	under phase-contrast microscopy; Western analysis of cell lysates
	for expression of mesenchymal phenotypic markers including fibronectin
	EDA (Fn-EDA), and expression of epithelial phenotypic markers including
	E-cadherin (E-cad). Markers of fibrogenesis, including collagens
	and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) were also evaluated by
	measuring mRNA level using RT-PCR, and protein by immunofluorescence
	or Western blotting. Signaling pathways for EMT were characterized
	by Western analysis of cell lysates using monoclonal antibodies to
	detect phosphorylated Erk1/2 and Smad2 after TGF-beta1 treatment
	in the presence or absence of MEK inhibitors. The role of Smad2 in
	TGF-beta1-mediated EMT was investigated using siRNA.The data showed
	that TGF-beta1, but not TNF-alpha or IL-1beta, induced A549 cells
	with an alveolar epithelial type II cell phenotype to undergo EMT
	in a time-and concentration-dependent manner. The process of EMT
	was accompanied by morphological alteration and expression of the
	fibroblast phenotypic markers Fn-EDA and vimentin, concomitant with
	a downregulation of the epithelial phenotype marker E-cad. Furthermore,
	cells that had undergone EMT showed enhanced expression of markers
	of fibrogenesis including collagens type I and III and CTGF. MMP-2
	expression was also evidenced. TGF-beta1-induced EMT occurred through
	phosphorylation of Smad2 and was inhibited by Smad2 gene silencing;
	MEK inhibitors failed to attenuate either EMT-associated Smad2 phosphorylation
	or the observed phenotypic changes.Our study shows that TGF-beta1
	induces A549 alveolar epithelial cells to undergo EMT via Smad2 activation.
	Our data support the concept of EMT in lung epithelial cells, and

	as determined by Northern and Western blot, was up-regulated during
	the conversion of myoblasts to myotubes. The mouse betaglycan gene

	of the mouse betaglycan promoter reporter was also up-regulated in
	differentiating C(2)C(12) cells. We found that MyoD, but not myogenin,
	stimulated this transcriptional activity even in the presence of
	high serum. Betaglycan promoter activity was increased by RA and
	inhibited by the three isoforms of TGF-beta. On the other hand, basic

	Furthermore, we show that all of these pathways are essential for

	prevents TGF-?2-induced EndMT. However, overexpression of Snail is
	not sufficient to cause EndMT. Chemical inhibition of GSK-3? (glycogen

	Abstract = {The secreted polypeptide transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)
	exerts its multiple activities through type I and II cell surface
	receptors. In epithelial cells, activation of the TGF-beta signal
	transduction pathways leads to inhibition of cell proliferation and
	an increase in extracellular matrix production. TGF-beta is widely
	expressed during development and its biological activity has been
	implicated in epithelial-mesenchymal interactions, e.g., in branching
	morphogenesis of the lung, kidney, and mammary gland, and in inductive
	events between mammary epithelium and stroma. In the present study,
	we investigated the effects of TGF-beta on mouse mammary epithelial
	cells in vitro. TGF-beta reversibly induced an alteration in the
	differentiation of normal mammary epithelial NMuMG cells from epithelial
	to fibroblastic phenotype. The change in cell morphology correlated
	with (a) decreased expression of the epithelial markers E-cadherin,
	ZO-1, and desmoplakin I and II; (b) increased expression of mesenchymal
	markers, such as fibronectin; and (c) a fibroblast-like reorganization
	of actin fibers. This phenotypic differentiation displays the hallmarks
	of an epithelial to mesenchymal transdifferentiation event. Since
	NMuMG cells make high levels of the type I TGF-beta receptor Tsk7L,
	yet lack expression of the ALK-5/R4 type I receptor which has been
	reported to mediate TGF-beta responsiveness, we evaluated the role
	of the Tsk7L receptor in TGF-beta-mediated transdifferentiation.
	We generated NMuMG cells that stably overexpress a truncated Tsk7L
	type I receptor that lacks most of the cytoplasmic kinase domain,
	thus function as a dominant negative mutant. These transfected cells
	no longer underwent epithelial to mesenchymal morphological change
	upon exposure to TGF-beta, yet still displayed some TGF-beta-mediated
	responses. We conclude that TGF-beta has the ability to modulate
	E-cadherin expression and induce a reversible epithelial to mesenchymal
	transdifferentiation in epithelial cells. Unlike other transdifferentiating
	growth factors, such as bFGF and HGF, these changes are accompanied
	by growth inhibition. Our results also implicate the Tsk7L type I

	Abstract = {The Snail transcription factor has been described recently as a strong
	repressor of E-cadherin in epithelial cell lines, where its stable
	expression leads to the loss of E-cadherin expression and induces
	epithelial-mesenchymal transitions and an invasive phenotype. The
	mechanisms regulating Snail expression in development and tumor progression
	are not yet known. We show here that transforming growth factor beta-1
	(TGFbeta1) induces Snail expression in Madin-Darby canine kidney
	cells and triggers epithelial-mesenchymal transitions by a mechanism
	dependent on the MAPK signaling pathway. Furthermore, TGFbeta1 induces
	the activity of Snail promoter, whereas fibroblast growth factor-2
	has a milder effect but cooperates with TGFbeta1 in the induction
	of Snail promoter. Interestingly, TGFbeta1-mediated induction of
	Snail promoter is blocked by a dominant negative form of H-Ras (N17Ras),
	whereas oncogenic H-Ras (V12Ras) induces Snail promoter activity
	and synergistically cooperates with TGFbeta1. The effects of TGFbeta1
	on Snail promoter are dependent of MEK1/2 activity but are apparently
	independent of Smad4 activity. In addition, H-Ras-mediated induction
	of Snail promoter, alone or in the presence of TGFbeta1, depends
	on both MAPK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activities. These
	data support that MAPK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling

	We previously have demonstrated in breast cancer cell lines that
	Smad2/3 signaling played a dominant role in mediating tumor suppressor
	effects on well-differentiated breast cancer cell lines grown as
	xenografts and prometastatic effects on a more invasive, metastatic
	cell line. Our present data based on selective interference with
	activation of endogenous Smad2 and Smad3 by stable expression of
	a mutant form of the TGF-beta type I receptor (RImL45) unable to
	bind Smad2/3 but with a functional kinase again show that reduction
	in Smad2/3 signaling by expression of RImL45 enhanced the malignancy
	of xenografted tumors of the well-differentiated MCF10A-derived tumor
	cell line MCF10CA1h, resulting in formation of larger tumors with
	a higher proliferative index and more malignant histologic features.
	In contrast, expression of RImL45 in the more aggressive MCF10CA1a
	cell line strongly suppressed formation of lung metastases following
	tail vein injection. These results suggest a causal, dominant role
	for the endogenous Smad2/3 signaling pathway in the tumor suppressor
	and prometastatic activities of TGF-beta in these cells. Using an

	including p38 and c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase, cooperate with TGF-beta/Smads
	in enhancing migration of metastatic MCF10CA1a cells, but that, although
	necessary for migration, these other pathways are not sufficient

	cells. EMT correlates with the ability of these ligands to induce
	growth arrest. Ectopic expression of all type I receptors of the

	Abstract = {The hallmark of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is the myofibroblast,
	the cellular origin of which in the lung is unknown. We hypothesized
	that alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) may serve as a source of myofibroblasts
	through epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Effects of chronic
	exposure to transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 on the phenotype
	of isolated rat AECs in primary culture and a rat type II cell line
	(RLE-6TN) were evaluated. Additionally, tissue samples from patients
	with IPF were evaluated for cells co-expressing epithelial (thyroid
	transcription factor (TTF)-1 and pro-surfactant protein-B (pro-SP-B),
	and mesenchymal (alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA)) markers.
	RLE-6TN cells exposed to TGF-beta1 for 6 days demonstrated increased
	expression of mesenchymal cell markers and a fibroblast-like morphology,
	an effect augmented by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Exposure
	of rat AECs to TGF-beta1 (100 pmol/L) resulted in increased expression
	of alpha-SMA, type I collagen, vimentin, and desmin, with concurrent
	transition to a fibroblast-like morphology and decreased expression
	of TTF-1, aquaporin-5 (AQP5), zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), and cytokeratins.
	Cells co-expressing epithelial markers and alpha-SMA were abundant
	in lung tissue from IPF patients. These results suggest that AECs
	undergo EMT when chronically exposed to TGF-beta1, raising the possibility
	that epithelial cells may serve as a novel source of myofibroblasts
	in IPF.},

	cells treated with TGF-beta1 for 1, 6, or 24 hours. Data analyses
	were performed using GenePixPro and GeneSpring software. Selected

	genes examined by microarray, 939 were upregulated or downregulated
	by TGF-beta. This represents approximately 10\% of the genes examined,
	minus redundancy. Seven genes previously not known to be regulated
	by TGF-beta at the transcriptional level (Akt and RhoB) or not at
	all (IQGAP1, mCalpain, actinin alpha3, Ikki, PP2A-PR53), were identified
	and their regulation by TGF-beta verified by northern blotting. Cell

Although differential functional roles of Smad2 and Smad3 are apparent in mammalian development, the relative functional roles of Smad2 and Smad3 in postnatal systems remain unclear. We used Cre/loxP-mediated gene targeting for hepatocyte-specific deletion of Smad2 (S2HeKO) in adult mice and generated hepatocyte-selective Smad2/Smad3 double knockouts by intercrossing AlbCre/Smad2(f/f) (S2HeKO) and Smad3-deficient Smad3ex8/ex8 (S3KO) mice. All strains were viable and had normal adult liver. However, necrogenic CCL4-induced hepatocyte proliferation was significantly increased in S2HeKO compared to Ctrl and S3KO livers, and transplanted S2HeKO hepatocytes repopulated recipient liver at dramatically increased rates compared to Ctrl hepatocytes in vivo. Using primary hepatocytes, we found that TGF-beta-induced G1 arrest, apoptosis, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in Ctrl and S2HeKO but not in S3KO hepatocytes. Interestingly, S2HeKO cells spontaneously acquired mesenchymal features characteristic of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Collectively, these results demonstrate that Smad2 suppresses hepatocyte growth and dedifferentiation independent of TGF-beta signaling. Smad2 is not required for TGF-beta-stimulated apoptosis, EMT, and growth inhibition in hepatocytes.},

	Abstract = {The cadherin superfamily of Ca(2+)-dependent homophilic adhesion molecules plays a critical role in regulating cell-to-cell interactions. During development, the expression of different cadherins is highly dynamic, since they are associated with the morphogenesis, establishment and/or maintenance of different tissues. Alterations in cadherin expression or function occur frequently during carcinogenesis, such as the loss of the epithelial cadherin (E-cadherin) and/or the aberrant expression of other cadherins. Indeed, the aberrant expression of cadherins has been detected during carcinoma invasion, a process which is reminiscent of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) so important in many critical developmental processes. The functional regulation of cadherins can occur at many different levels, from transcriptional regulation to the control of the strength of the cadherin-mediated cell-cell interaction. In this review, we will focus on the transcriptional control of cadherin expression, both in development and carcinogenesis, paying particular attention to the regulation of E-cadherin given its proposed role as a suppressor of invasion. We will discuss the main genetic and epigenetic mechanisms involved in down-regulating E-cadherin expression, and we will analyse the mechanisms involved in regulating EMT, in an attempt to elucidate which elements are common to this process in both physiological and pathological situations.},

	Abstract = {New research suggests that, during tubulointerstitial fibrosis, alpha-smooth muscle actin (SMA)-expressing mesenchymal cells might derive from the tubular epithelium via epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Although transforming growth factor-beta(1) (TGF-beta(1)) plays a key role in EMT, the underlying cellular mechanisms are not well understood. Here we characterized TGF-beta(1)-induced EMT in LLC-PK(1) cells and examined the role of the small GTPase Rho and its effector, Rho kinase, (ROK) in the ensuing cytoskeletal remodeling and SMA expression. TGF-beta(1) treatment caused delocalization and downregulation of cell contact proteins (ZO-1, E-cadherin, beta-catenin), cytoskeleton reorganization (stress fiber assembly, myosin light chain phosphorylation), and robust SMA synthesis. TGF-beta(1) induced a biphasic Rho activation. Stress fiber assembly was prevented by the Rho-inhibiting C3 transferase and by dominant negative (DN) ROK. The SMA promoter was activated strongly by constitutively active Rho but not ROK. Accordingly, TGF-beta(1)-induced SMA promoter activation was potently abrogated by two Rho-inhibiting constructs, C3 transferase and p190RhoGAP, but not by DN-ROK. Truncation analysis showed that the first CC(A/T)richGG (CArG B) serum response factor-binding cis element is essential for the Rho responsiveness of the SMA promoter. Thus Rho plays a dual role in TGF-beta(1)-induced EMT of renal epithelial cells. It is indispensable both for cytoskeleton remodeling and for the activation of the SMA promoter. The cytoskeletal effects are mediated via the Rho/ROK pathway, whereas the transcriptional effects are partially ROK independent.},

	Abstract = {Transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) is the prototypic member of a large family of structurally related pleiotropic-secreted cytokines that play a pivotal role in the control of differentiation, proliferation, and state of activation of many different cell types including immune cells. TGF-beta family members have potent immunosuppressor activities in vitro and in vivo. These cytokines trigger their biological effects by inducing the formation of a heteromeric transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptor complex. These receptors then initiate intracellular signaling through activation of Smad proteins, and specific Smads become phosphorylated and associate with other Smads. These heteromeric Smad complexes accumulate in the nucleus, where they modulate the expression of target genes. Recent data support the notion that Smads are important intracellular effectors of TGF-beta in immune cells. Here, we review recent advances in TGF-beta signal transduction in immune cells.},

	Abstract = {Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) has a dual role in carcinogenesis, acting as a growth inhibitor in early tumor stages and a promoter of cell proliferation in advanced diseases. Although this cellular phenomenon is well established, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we report that sequential induction of NFAT and c-Myc transcription factors is sufficient and required for the TGF-beta switch from a cell cycle inhibitor to a growth promoter pathway in cancer cells. Mechanistically, TGF-beta induces in a calcineurin-dependent manner the expression and activation of NFAT factors, which then translocate into the nucleus to promote c-Myc expression. In response to TGF-beta, activated NFAT factors bind to and displace Smad3 repressor complexes from the previously identified TGF-beta inhibitory element (TIE) to transactivate the c-Myc promoter. c-Myc in turn stimulates cell cycle progression and growth through up-regulation of D-type cyclins. Most importantly, NFAT knockdown not only prevents c-Myc activation and cell proliferation, but also partially restores TGF-beta-induced cell cycle arrest and growth suppression. Taken together, this study provides the first evidence for a Smad-independent master regulatory pathway in TGF-beta-promoted cell growth that is defined by sequential transcriptional activation of NFAT and c-Myc factors.},

A high-affinity calcineurin-binding peptide was selected from combinatorial peptide libraries based on the calcineurin docking motif of NFAT. This peptide potently inhibited NFAT activation and NFAT-dependent expression of endogenous cytokine genes in T cells, without affecting the expression of other cytokines that require calcineurin but not NFAT. Substitution of the optimized peptide sequence into the natural calcineurin docking site increased the calcineurin responsiveness of NFAT.

	Abstract = {To determine how extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) 1/2 promote mammary tumorigenesis, we examined the real-time behavior of cells in an organotypic culture of the mammary glandular epithelium. Inducible activation of ERK1/2 in mature acini elicits cell motility and disrupts epithelial architecture in a manner that is reminiscent of ductal carcinoma in situ; however, motile cells do not invade through the basement membrane and branching morphogenesis does not take place. ERK1/2-induced motility causes cells to move both within the cell monolayer that contacts the basement membrane surrounding the acinus and through the luminal space of the acinus. E-cadherin expression is reduced after ERK1/2 activation, but motility does not involve an epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Cell motility and the disruption of epithelial architecture require a Rho kinase- and myosin light chain kinase-dependent increase in the phosphorylation of myosin light chain 2. Our results identify a new mechanism for the disruption of architecture in epithelial acini and suggest that ERK1/2 can promote noninvasive motility in preinvasive mammary tumors.},

Whereas formation of the normal blood vasculature requires the interaction of many different agonists and inhibitors, including vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) and other members of the vascular permeability factor/VEGF family, pathological angiogenesis is a cruder, simpler process that can be replicated by a single VEGF-A isoform, VEGF-A(164/5). VEGF-A(164/5) induces the formation of several distinctly different types of new blood vessels that differ from normal blood vessels with respect to organization, structure, and function.

	Abstract = {Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1)‑induced epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT) is one of the important cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in renal fibrosis. Smad3 and miR-192 (a Smad3-dependent microRNA) are involved in TGF-β1-mediated EMT. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a renal tubular epithelial survival factor. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated the role of Smad3 and miR‑192 in the effects of VEGF on TGF‑β1‑mediated tubular EMT. A human kidney cortex (HKC) cell line stably overexpressing VEGF (HKC-SOEV) was established. The normal HKC cells and HKC‑SOEV cells were treated with TGF-β1 (5 µg/l) or/and LY294002 (20 µmol/l) for 24 and 48 h (LY294002 blocks the effect of VEGF). The protein expression of Smad2, Smad3, Smad4 and phosphorylated Smad3 (p‑Smad3) were measured by western blot analysis. The expression of Smad3 and miR-192 was determined by real‑time PCR. E-cadherin and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) expression was detected by western blot analysis and laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM). TGF-β1 was found to induce the expression of α-SMA in the HKC cells. TGF-β1 also induced Smad3, miR-192 and p-Smad3 expression, but suppressed E‑cadherin expression. However, in the HKC-SOEV cells, the expression levels of α-SMA, Smad3, miR-192 and p‑Smad3 upon TGF-β1 stimulation were significantly reduced. In these cells, the suppressive effect of TGF-β1 on E‑cadherin was also reduced. Importantly, treatment with LY294002 significantly diminished the effect of VEGF. VEGF suppressed Smad3 and miR‑192, and subsequently inhibited EMT induced by TGF-β1.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate the expression of stem cell-related markers at the cellular level in human breast tumors of different subtypes and histologic stage.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We performed immunohistochemical analyses of 12 proteins [CD44, CD24, ALDH1, vimentin, osteonectin, EPCR, caveolin 1, connexin 43, cytokeratin 18 (CK18), MUC1, claudin 7, and GATA3] selected based on their differential expression in breast cancer cells with more differentiated and stem cell-like characteristics in 47 cases of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) only, 135 cases of IDC with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), 35 cases of DCIS with microinvasion, and 58 cases of pure DCIS. We also analyzed 73 IDCs with adjacent DCIS to determine the differences in the expression of markers by histology within individual tumors. CD44+/CD24- and CD24-/CD24+ cells were detected using double immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: CD44 and EPCR expression was different among the four histologic groups and was lower in invasive compared with in situ tumors, especially in luminal A subtype. The expression of vimentin, osteonectin, connexin 43, ALDH1, CK18, GATA3, and MUC1 differed by tumor subtype in some histologic groups. ALDH1-positive cells were more frequent in basal-like and HER2+ than in luminal tumors. CD44+/CD24- cells were detected in 69% of all tumors with 100% of the basal-like and 52% of HER2+ tumors having some of these cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that in breast cancer, the frequency of tumor cells positive for stem cell-like and more differentiated cell markers varies according to tumor subtype and histologic stage.},

	Abstract = {AIM: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been shown to be a survival factor for renal tubular epithelial cells. In the present study, we investigated whether administration of VEGF ameliorates tubulointerstitial fibrosis in a mouse model of unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO).
METHODS: Thirty-six male CD-1 mice were randomly divided into three groups: sham-operation, UUO and UUO+VEGF group. VEGF (50 μg/kg) was subcutaneously injected twice daily from d 1 to d 14. Mice in each group were killed at d 3, 7, or 14 after the operation, and the tubulointerstitial fibrosis was histopathologically evaluated. Human proximal tubular epithelial cells (HK-2) were used for in vitro study. The expression levels of α-SMA, E-cadherin, TGF-β1, CTGF, and BMP-7 in the kidney were determined using Western blot and RT-PCR.
RESULTS: In the UUO mice, the degree of interstitial fibrosis was dramatically increased in a time-dependent manner. At d 3, 7, and 14, both the mRNA and protein expression levels for α-SMA, TGF-β1, and CTGF were significantly upregulated, whereas those for E-cadherin and BMP-7 were significantly downregulated. At d 3 and 7, VEGF treatment significantly reduced interstitial fibrosis and the expression levels for α-SMA, TGF-β1, and CTGF, while significantly increased the expression of E-cadherin and BMP-7, as compared with the UUO mice. At d 14 after operation, no significant differences were observed in the expression of the examined markers between VEGF-treated mice and UUO mice, with the exception of CTGF. In HK-2 cells, VEGF blocked TGF-β1-induced α-SMA and vimentin expression and restored E-cadherin expression in a dose-dependent manner.
CONCLUSION: VEGF may ameliorate renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis at the early stage in UUO mice. This effect may be related to inhibition of VEGF on renal tubular epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).},

	Abstract = {The majority of congenital heart defects arise from abnormal development of valvuloseptal tissue. The primordia of the valve leaflets and membranous septa of the heart are the cardiac cushions. Remodeling of the cushions is associated with a transitional extracellular matrix that includes sulfated proteoglycans and the microfibrillar proteins fibulin and fibrillin. Cushion formation is restricted to the AV canal and ventricular outflow tract regions of the primary heart tube. The proper placement of the cushions may be the result of the development of the primary heart tube as a segmented organ, as well as the subsequent looping of the heart. Segmentation of the heart tube may be demonstrated by the alternating molecular expression pattern along the longitudinal axis. In support of this hypothesis is the restricted expression of BMP-4 and msx-2 to the AV canal and ventricular outflow tract. The importance of looping for cushion positioning may imply that the iv and inv genes and retinoic acid are important for the proper patterning of the heart. The cells of the cushions evolve from endocardial cells that undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transformation. This developmental event is regulated by the myocardium and is probably due to the production of protein complexes, present within the cardiac jelly of the cushion-forming regions, that consist of fibronectin and the ES proteins. Both the cushion mesenchyme and its endocardial cell antecedents express JB3, an ECM protein. JB3 expression is also featured within the heart-forming fields of the primary mesoderm, from which the endocardial progenitors of the cushion cells originate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Much recent work on robustness and evolvability has focused on the structure of neutral spaces, in which system behavior remains invariant to mutations. Recently we have shown that the collective behavior of multiparameter models is most often sloppy: insensitive to changes except along a few 'stiff' combinations of parameters, with an enormous sloppy neutral subspace. Robustness is often assumed to be an emergent evolved property, but the sloppiness natural to biochemical networks offers an alternative nonadaptive explanation. Conversely, ideas developed to study evolvability in robust systems can be usefully extended to characterize sloppy systems.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most of the modeling performed in the area of systems biology aims at achieving a quantitative description of the intracellular pathways within a "typical cell". However, in many biologically important situations even clonal cell populations can show a heterogeneous response. These situations require study of cell-to-cell variability and the development of models for heterogeneous cell populations.
RESULTS: In this paper we consider cell populations in which the dynamics of every single cell is captured by a parameter dependent differential equation. Differences among cells are modeled by differences in parameters which are subject to a probability density. A novel Bayesian approach is presented to infer this probability density from population snapshot data, such as flow cytometric analysis, which do not provide single cell time series data. The presented approach can deal with sparse and noisy measurement data. Furthermore, it is appealing from an application point of view as in contrast to other methods the uncertainty of the resulting parameter distribution can directly be assessed.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method is evaluated using artificial experimental data from a model of the tumor necrosis factor signaling network. We demonstrate that the methods are computationally efficient and yield good estimation result even for sparse data sets.},

	Abstract = {The canonical nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway controls a gene network important in the cellular inflammatory response. Upon activation, NF-κB/RelA is released from cytoplasmic inhibitors, from where it translocates into the nucleus, subsequently activating negative feedback loops producing either monophasic or damped oscillatory nucleo-cytoplasmic dynamics. Although the population behavior of the NF-κB pathway has been extensively modeled, the sources of cell-to-cell variability are not well understood. We describe an integrated experimental-computational analysis of NF-κB/RelA translocation in a validated cell model exhibiting monophasic dynamics. Quantitative measures of cellular geometry and total cytoplasmic concentration and translocated RelA amounts were used as priors in Bayesian inference to estimate biophysically realistic parameter values based on dynamic live cell imaging studies of enhanced GFP-tagged RelA in stable transfectants. Bayesian inference was performed on multiple cells simultaneously, assuming identical reaction rate parameters, whereas cellular geometry and initial and total NF-κB concentration-related parameters were cell-specific. A subpopulation of cells exhibiting distinct kinetic profiles was identified that corresponded to differences in the IκBα translation rate. We conclude that cellular geometry, initial and total NF-κB concentration, IκBα translation, and IκBα degradation rates account for distinct cell-to-cell differences in canonical NF-κB translocation dynamics.},

	Abstract = {The role of mechanistic modeling and systems biology in molecular medicine remains unclear. In this study, we explored whether uncertain models could be used to understand how a network responds to a therapeutic intervention. As a proof of concept, we modeled and analyzed the response of the human coagulation cascade to recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) and prothrombin (fII) addition in normal and hemophilic plasma. An ensemble of parametrically uncertain human coagulation models was developed (N = 437). Each model described the time evolution of 193 proteins and protein complexes interconnected by 301 interactions under quiescent flow. The 467 unknown model parameters were estimated, using multiobjective optimization, from published in vitro coagulation studies. The model ensemble was validated using published in vitro thrombin measurements and thrombin measurements taken from coronary artery disease patients. Sensitivity analysis was then used to rank-order the importance of model parameters as a function of experimental or physiological conditions. A novel strategy for the systematic comparison of ranks identified a family of fX/FXa and fII/FIIa interactions that became more sensitive with decreasing fVIII/fIX. The fragility of these interactions was preserved following the addition of exogenous rFVIIa and fII. This suggested that exogenous rFVIIa did not alter the qualitative operation of the cascade. Rather, exogenous rFVIIa and fII took advantage of existing fluid and interfacial fX/FXa and fII/FIIa sensitivity to restore normal coagulation in low fVIII/fIX conditions. The proposed rFVIIa mechanism of action was consistent with experimental literature not used in model training. Thus, we demonstrated that an ensemble of uncertain models could unravel key facets of the mechanism of action of a focused intervention. Whereas the current study was limited to coagulation, perhaps the general strategy used could be extended to other molecular networks relevant to human health.},

	Abstract = {In this article, we propose an individual-based and stochastic modeling approach that is capable of describing the bacterial cell population dynamics during a batch culture. All stochastic nature inherent in intracellular molecular level reactions and cell division processes were considered in a single model framework by embedding a sub-model describing individual cell's growth kinetics in a discrete event simulation algorithm. The resultant unique feature of the model is that the effects of the stochasticities on the cell population dynamics can be investigated for different substrate-dependent cell growth kinetics. When Monod kinetics was used as the sub-model, the stochasticities only slightly affected the cell mass increase and substrate consumption profiles during the batch culture although they were still important in describing the changes of cell population distributions. When Andrews substrate inhibition kinetics was used, however, it was revealed that the overall cell population dynamics could be seriously influenced by the stochasticities. Under a critical initial substrate level, the cell population could proliferate against the substrate inhibition only when the stochasticities were considered.},

@article{Swain:2002ve,
	Abstract = {Gene expression is a stochastic, or "noisy," process. This noise comes about in two ways. The inherent stochasticity of biochemical processes such as transcription and translation generates "intrinsic" noise. In addition, fluctuations in the amounts or states of other cellular components lead indirectly to variation in the expression of a particular gene and thus represent "extrinsic" noise. Here, we show how the total variation in the level of expression of a given gene can be decomposed into its intrinsic and extrinsic components. We demonstrate theoretically that simultaneous measurement of two identical genes per cell enables discrimination of these two types of noise. Analytic expressions for intrinsic noise are given for a model that involves all the major steps in transcription and translation. These expressions give the sensitivity to various parameters, quantify the deviation from Poisson statistics, and provide a way of fitting experiment. Transcription dominates the intrinsic noise when the average number of proteins made per mRNA transcript is greater than approximately 2. Below this number, translational effects also become important. Gene replication and cell division, included in the model, cause protein numbers to tend to a limit cycle. We calculate a general form for the extrinsic noise and illustrate it with the particular case of a single fluctuating extrinsic variable-a repressor protein, which acts on the gene of interest. All results are confirmed by stochastic simulation using plausible parameters for Escherichia coli.},

	Abstract = {The protein p53 functions as a tumor suppressor and can trigger either cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in response to DNA damage. We used Boolean network modeling and attractor landscape analysis to analyze the state transition dynamics of a simplified p53 network for which particular combinations of activation states of the molecules corresponded to specific cellular outcomes. Our results identified five critical interactions in the network that determined the cellular response to DNA damage, and simulations lacking any of these interactions produced states associated with sustained p53 activity, which corresponded to a cell death response. Attractor landscape analysis of the cellular response to DNA damage of the breast cancer cell line MCF7 and the effect of the Mdm2 (murine double minute 2) inhibitor nutlin-3 indicated that nutlin-3 would exhibit limited efficacy in triggering cell death, because the cell death state was not induced to a large extent by simulations with nutlin-3 and instead produced a state consistent with oscillatory p53 dynamics and cell cycle arrest. Attractor landscape analysis also suggested that combining nutlin-3 with inhibition of Wip1 would synergize to stimulate a sustained increase in p53 activity and promote p53-mediated cell death. We validated this synergistic effect in stimulating p53 activity and triggering cell death with single-cell imaging of a fluorescent p53 reporter in MCF7 cells. Thus, attractor landscape analysis of p53 network dynamics and its regulation can identify potential therapeutic strategies for treating cancer.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cells process signals using complex and dynamic networks. Studying how this is performed in a context and cell type specific way is essential to understand signaling both in physiological and diseased situations. Context-specific medium/high throughput proteomic data measured upon perturbation is now relatively easy to obtain but formalisms that can take advantage of these features to build models of signaling are still comparatively scarce.
RESULTS: Here we present CellNOptR, an open-source R software package for building predictive logic models of signaling networks by training networks derived from prior knowledge to signaling (typically phosphoproteomic) data. CellNOptR features different logic formalisms, from Boolean models to differential equations, in a common framework. These different logic model representations accommodate state and time values with increasing levels of detail. We provide in addition an interface via Cytoscape (CytoCopteR) to facilitate use and integration with Cytoscape network-based capabilities.
CONCLUSIONS: Models generated with this pipeline have two key features. First, they are constrained by prior knowledge about the network but trained to data. They are therefore context and cell line specific, which results in enhanced predictive and mechanistic insights. Second, they can be built using different logic formalisms depending on the richness of the available data. Models built with CellNOptR are useful tools to understand how signals are processed by cells and how this is altered in disease. They can be used to predict the effect of perturbations (individual or in combinations), and potentially to engineer therapies that have differential effects/side effects depending on the cell type or context.},

	Abstract = {Insulin, the primary hormone regulating the level of glucose in the bloodstream, modulates a variety of cellular and enzymatic processes in normal and diseased cells. Insulin signals are processed by a complex network of biochemical interactions which ultimately induce gene expression programs or other processes such as translation initiation. Surprisingly, despite the wealth of literature on insulin signaling, the relative importance of the components linking insulin with translation initiation remains unclear. We addressed this question by developing and interrogating a family of mathematical models of insulin induced translation initiation. The insulin network was modeled using mass-action kinetics within an ordinary differential equation (ODE) framework. A family of model parameters was estimated, starting from an initial best fit parameter set, using 24 experimental data sets taken from literature. The residual between model simulations and each of the experimental constraints were simultaneously minimized using multiobjective optimization. Interrogation of the model population, using sensitivity and robustness analysis, identified an insulin-dependent switch that controlled translation initiation. Our analysis suggested that without insulin, a balance between the pro-initiation activity of the GTP-binding protein Rheb and anti-initiation activity of PTEN controlled basal initiation. On the other hand, in the presence of insulin a combination of PI3K and Rheb activity controlled inducible initiation, where PI3K was only critical in the presence of insulin. Other well known regulatory mechanisms governing insulin action, for example IRS-1 negative feedback, modulated the relative importance of PI3K and Rheb but did not fundamentally change the signal flow.},

	Abstract = {Advances in molecular biology provide an opportunity to develop detailed models of biological processes that can be used to obtain an integrated understanding of the system. However, development of useful models from the available knowledge of the system and experimental observations still remains a daunting task. In this work, a model identification strategy for complex biological networks is proposed. The approach includes a state regulator problem (SRP) that provides estimates of all the component concentrations and the reaction rates of the network using the available measurements. The full set of the estimates is utilised for model parameter identification for the network of known topology. An a priori model complexity test that indicates the feasibility of performance of the proposed algorithm is developed. Fisher information matrix (FIM) theory is used to address model identifiability issues. Two signalling pathway case studies, the caspase function in apoptosis and the MAP kinase cascade system, are considered. The MAP kinase cascade, with measurements restricted to protein complex concentrations, fails the a priori test and the SRP estimates are poor as expected. The apoptosis network structure used in this work has moderate complexity and is suitable for application of the proposed tools. Using a measurement set of seven protein concentrations, accurate estimates for all unknowns are obtained. Furthermore, the effects of measurement sampling frequency and quality of information in the measurement set on the performance of the identified model are described.},

	Abstract = {When modeling cell signaling networks, a balance must be struck between mechanistic detail and ease of interpretation. In this paper we apply a fuzzy logic framework to the analysis of a large, systematic dataset describing the dynamics of cell signaling downstream of TNF, EGF, and insulin receptors in human colon carcinoma cells. Simulations based on fuzzy logic recapitulate most features of the data and generate several predictions involving pathway crosstalk and regulation. We uncover a relationship between MK2 and ERK pathways that might account for the previously identified pro-survival influence of MK2. We also find unexpected inhibition of IKK following EGF treatment, possibly due to down-regulation of autocrine signaling. More generally, fuzzy logic models are flexible, able to incorporate qualitative and noisy data, and powerful enough to produce quantitative predictions and new biological insights about the operation of signaling networks.},

	Abstract = {Predictive understanding of cell signaling network operation based on general prior knowledge but consistent with empirical data in a specific environmental context is a current challenge in computational biology. Recent work has demonstrated that Boolean logic can be used to create context-specific network models by training proteomic pathway maps to dedicated biochemical data; however, the Boolean formalism is restricted to characterizing protein species as either fully active or inactive. To advance beyond this limitation, we propose a novel form of fuzzy logic sufficiently flexible to model quantitative data but also sufficiently simple to efficiently construct models by training pathway maps on dedicated experimental measurements. Our new approach, termed constrained fuzzy logic (cFL), converts a prior knowledge network (obtained from literature or interactome databases) into a computable model that describes graded values of protein activation across multiple pathways. We train a cFL-converted network to experimental data describing hepatocytic protein activation by inflammatory cytokines and demonstrate the application of the resultant trained models for three important purposes: (a) generating experimentally testable biological hypotheses concerning pathway crosstalk, (b) establishing capability for quantitative prediction of protein activity, and (c) prediction and understanding of the cytokine release phenotypic response. Our methodology systematically and quantitatively trains a protein pathway map summarizing curated literature to context-specific biochemical data. This process generates a computable model yielding successful prediction of new test data and offering biological insight into complex datasets that are difficult to fully analyze by intuition alone.},

	Abstract = {Modeling of signal transduction pathways plays a major role in understanding cells' function and predicting cellular response. Mathematical formalisms based on a logic formalism are relatively simple but can describe how signals propagate from one protein to the next and have led to the construction of models that simulate the cells response to environmental or other perturbations. Constrained fuzzy logic was recently introduced to train models to cell specific data to result in quantitative pathway models of the specific cellular behavior. There are two major issues in this pathway optimization: i) excessive CPU time requirements and ii) loosely constrained optimization problem due to lack of data with respect to large signaling pathways. Herein, we address both issues: the former by reformulating the pathway optimization as a regular nonlinear optimization problem; and the latter by enhanced algorithms to pre/post-process the signaling network to remove parts that cannot be identified given the experimental conditions. As a case study, we tackle the construction of cell type specific pathways in normal and transformed hepatocytes using medium and large-scale functional phosphoproteomic datasets. The proposed Non Linear Programming (NLP) formulation allows for fast optimization of signaling topologies by combining the versatile nature of logic modeling with state of the art optimization algorithms.},

@article{Cirit:2012kx,
	Abstract = {Signal transduction networks in mammalian cells, comprising a limited set of interacting biochemical pathways, are accessed by various growth factor and cytokine receptors to elicit distinct cell responses. This raises the question as to how specificity of the stimulus-response relationship is encoded at the molecular level. It has been proposed that specificity arises not only from the activation of unique signalling pathways, but also from quantitative differences in the activation and regulation of shared receptor-proximal signalling proteins. To address such hypotheses, data sets with greater precision and coverage of experimental conditions will need to be acquired, and rigorous frameworks that codify and parameterize the inherently non-linear relationships among signalling activities will need to be developed. In the present study we apply a systematic approach combining quantitative measurements and mathematical modelling to compare the signalling networks accessed by FGF (fibroblast growth factor) and PDGF (platelet-derived growth factor) receptors in mouse fibroblasts, in which the ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase) cascade is activated by Ras- and PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase)-dependent pathways. We show that, whereas the FGF stimulation of PI3K signalling is relatively weak, this deficiency is compensated for by a more potent Ras-dependent activation of ERK. Thus, as the modelling would predict, the ERK pathway is activated to a greater extent in cells co-stimulated with FGF and PDGF, relative to the saturated levels achieved with either ligand alone. It is envisaged that similar approaches will prove valuable in the elucidation of quantitative differences among other closely related receptor signalling networks.},

	Abstract = {Receptor-mediated signal transduction networks, comprised of multiple biochemical pathways, control cell responses and are therefore central to normal and aberrant physiological processes. An appreciation for the inherent complexities of these networks has matured in recent years, to the point where it is now apparent that experimental measurements will need to be combined with computational modeling and analysis to best interpret and predict how individual mechanisms (proteinprotein interactions, enzymatic reactions, etc.,) are integrated at the network level. To progress along these lines, there is a major barrier to overcome: although a deep mechanistic understanding of signal transduction has been achieved, data sets of a suitably quantitative nature are still lacking. Based on our efforts to systematically acquire and analyze such measurements, we contend that the level of detail in models of signaling networks ought to be limited by the availability of quantitative data, rather than by the much greater availability of qualitative information about signaling interactions. Although this approach is sensible from a data-driven modeling perspective, it is controversial because it gives the false impression that molecular-level details are being ignored.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ), which is implicated in metastasis to various organs in breast cancer, is a potential target for new antitumor metastasis drugs.
METHODS: To identify specific inhibitors of TGFβ receptor 1 (TGFβR1) in breast cancer metastasis, a virtual library of more than 400000 different compounds was screened by molecular docking modeling and confirmed with Smad-binding element luciferase and TGFβR1 kinase assays. Affymetrix GeneChip expression analysis of mRNA levels and real-time polymerase chain reaction were performed to determine expression changes of TGFβ-mediated, metastasis-associated genes in breast cancer cells after treatment with the small-molecule inhibitor YR-290. YR-290 was also examined for its effects on breast cancer migration, invasion, and metastasis using transwell and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) assays in vitro and three different mouse (BALB/c and NU/NU nude) models (n = 10 per group). Kaplan-Meier analyses were used to assess survival. All statistical tests were two-sided.
RESULTS: YR-290 interacted with the kinase domain of TGFβR1, abrogated kinase activity (half maximal inhibitory concentration = 137nM, 95% confidence interval = 126.4 to 147.6nM) and inhibited the TGFβ-mediated downstream signaling pathway and metastasis-associated genes in breast cancer cells. YR-290 inhibited TGFβ-modulated breast cancer cell migration and invasion. In tumor metastasis mouse models, YR-290 almost completely blocked cancer metastasis. Numbers of lung tumor nodules of mice treated with 1mg/kg and 5mg/kg YR-290 were reduced by 74.93% (95% confidence interval = 61.45% to 88.41%) and 94.93% (95% confidence interval = 82.13% to 100%), respectively, compared with control mice. Treatment with YR-290 also statistically significantly prolonged the survival of tumor-bearing mice.
CONCLUSIONS: YR-290 is a novel inhibitor of tumor metastasis that works by blocking TGFβ signaling pathways.},

	Abstract = {Recent evidence suggests that extracellular matrix components may
	play a signaling role in embryonic valve development. We have previously
	identified the spatiotemporal expression patterns of periostin in
	developing valves, but its function during this process is largely
	unknown. To evaluate the functional role periostin plays during valvulogenesis,
	two separate three-dimensional culture assay systems, which model
	chick atrioventricular cushion development, were employed. These
	assays demonstrated that cushion mesenchymal cells adhered and spread
	on purified periostin in a dose-responsive manner, similar to collagen
	I and fibronectin via alpha(v)beta(3) and beta(1) integrin pairs.
	Periostin overexpression resulted in enhanced mesenchyme invasion
	through 3D collagen gels and increased matrix compaction. This invasion
	was dependent on alpha(v)beta(3) more than beta(1) integrin signaling,
	and was mediated differentially by Rho kinase and PI 3-kinase. Both
	matrix invasion and compaction were associated with a colocalization
	of periostin and beta(1) integrin expression to migratory cell phenotype
	in both surface and deep cells. The Rho/PI 3-kinase pathway also
	differentially mediated matrix compaction. Both Rho and PI 3-kinase
	were involved in normal cushion mesenchyme matrix compaction, but
	only PI 3-kinase was required for the enhanced matrix compaction
	due to periostin. Taken together, these results highlight periostin
	as a mediator of matrix remodeling by cushion mesenchyme towards
	a mature valve structure.},

	Abstract = {Despite years of research, limited understanding of heart valve cell
	and tissue biology remains a key impediment to valvular tissue engineering
	progress. Heart valves rapidly evolve structural and cellular composition
	naturally during embryonic development, which suggests that mimicking
	these signaling events could advance engineered valve tissue research.
	Many inductive factors participate in the initial endocardial to
	mesenchymal transformation event necessary to form the prevalvular
	cushion, but far less is known about the regulation of cushion remodeling
	into fibrous leaflets and the associated maturation of valvular progenitors
	into fibroblasts. In this study, we combine in vitro three-dimensional
	tissue-engineered models of embryonic valvular remodeling with in
	vivo analysis to determine the roles of three prominent growth factors
	during avian mitral valvulogenesis. We show that transforming growth
	factor-?3 (TGF?3), bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2), and vascular
	endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) are expressed in spatiotemporally
	distinct patterns and at significantly different levels within remodeling
	embryonic valves in vivo. We then establish dose-dependent functional
	roles for each growth factor in 3D cultured embryonic valve progenitor
	cells. TGF?3 induced cell migration, invasion, and matrix condensation;
	BMP2 induced invasion. VEGFA inhibited invasion but increased migration.
	Finally, we determine that TGF?3 induced myofibroblastic differentiation
	in a dose-dependent manner, whereas VEGFA and BMP2 did not. Collectively,
	these findings frame a naturally derived blueprint for controlling
	valvulogenic remodeling and phenotype maturation, which can be integrated

	Abstract = {Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) signaling, which regulates
	multiple cellular processes including proliferation, apoptosis, and
	differentiation, plays an important but incompletely understood role
	in normal and cancerous tissues. For instance, although TGF-beta
	functions as a tumor suppressor in the premalignant stages of tumorigenesis,
	paradoxically, it also seems to act as a tumor promoter in advanced
	cancer leading to metastasis. The mechanisms by which TGF-beta elicits
	such diverse responses during cancer progression are still not entirely
	clear. As a first step toward understanding TGF-beta signaling quantitatively,
	we have developed a comprehensive, dynamic model of the canonical
	TGF-beta pathway via Smad transcription factors. By describing how
	an extracellular signal of the TGF-beta ligand is sensed by receptors
	and transmitted into the nucleus through intracellular Smad proteins,
	the model provides quantitative insight into how TGF-beta-induced
	responses are modulated and regulated. Subsequent model analysis
	shows that mechanisms associated with Smad activation by ligand-activated
	receptor, nuclear complex formation among Smad proteins, and inactivation
	of ligand-activated Smad (e.g., degradation, dephosphorylation) may
	be critical for regulating TGF-beta-targeted functional responses.
	The model was also used to predict dynamic characteristics of the
	Smad-mediated pathway in abnormal cells, from which we generated
	four testable hypotheses regarding potential mechanisms by which
	TGF-beta's tumor-suppressive roles may appear to morph into tumor-promotion
	during cancer progression.},

	growth-arrested acini-like spheroids that recapitulate several aspects
	of glandular architecture in vivo. Oncogenes introduced into MCF-10A
	cells disrupt this morphogenetic process, and elicit distinct morphological

	heterogeneity observed among different oncogenes (e.g., ErbB2, cyclin
	D1) have illustrated the utility of this three-dimensional culture
	system in modeling the biological activities of cancer genes, particularly
	with regard to their ability to disrupt epithelial architecture during
	the early aspects of carcinoma formation. Here we provide a collection
	of protocols to culture MCF-10A cells, to establish stable pools
	expressing a gene of interest via retroviral infection, as well as
	to grow and analyze MCF-10A cells in three-dimensional basement membrane

	Abstract = {Cleft palate is among the most common birth defects in humans, caused
	by a failure in the complex multistep developmental process of palatogenesis.
	It has been recently shown that transforming growth factor beta3
	(Tgf-beta3) is an absolute requirement for successful palatal fusion,
	both in mice and humans. However, very little is known about the
	mechanisms of Tgf-beta3 signaling during this process. Here we show
	that putative Tgf-beta type I receptors, Alk-1, Alk-2, and Alk-5,
	are all endogenously expressed in the palatal epithelium. Activation
	of Alk-5 in the Tgf-beta3 (-/-) palatal epithelium is able to rescue
	palatal fusion, whereas inactivation of Alk-5 in the wild-type palatal
	epithelium prevents palatal fusion. The effect of Alk-2 is similar,
	but less pronounced. The induction of fusion by activation of Alk-5
	or Alk-2 is stronger in the posterior parts of the palates at the
	embryonic day 14 (E14), while their activation at E13.5 also restores
	anterior fusion, reflecting the natural anterior-posterior direction
	of palate maturation in vivo. We also show that Smad2 is endogenously
	activated in the palatal midline epithelial seam (MES) during the
	fusion process. By using a mutant Alk-5 receptor that is an active
	kinase but is unable to activate Smads, we show that activation of
	Smad-independent Tgf-beta responses is not sufficient to induce fusion
	of shelves deficient in Tgf-beta3. Based on these observations, we
	conclude that the Smad2-dependent Alk-5 signaling pathway is dominant
	in palatal fusion driven by Tgf-beta3.},

	Abstract = {MAP kinases (MAPKs), which control mitogenic signal transduction in
	all eukaryotic organisms, are inactivated by dual specificity MAPK
	phosphatases (DS-MKPs). Recent studies reveal that substrate specificity
	and enzymatic activity of MKPs are tightly controlled not only by
	the conserved C-terminal phosphatase domain but also by an N-terminal
	(NT) kinase-binding domain. Notably, MKPs that consist of a kinase-binding
	domain and a phosphatase domain exhibit little phosphatase activity
	in the absence of their physiological substrates. MKP binding to
	a specific MAPK results in enzymatic activation of the phosphatase
	in a substrate-induced activation mechanism. This direct coupling
	of inactivation of an MAPK to activation of an MKP provides a tightly
	controlled regulation that enables these two key enzymes to keep
	each other in check, thus guaranteeing the fidelity of signal transduction.
	This review discusses the recent understanding of structure and regulation
	of the large family of dual specificity MKPs, which can be divided
	into four subgroups according to their functional domains and mechanism
	of substrate recognition and enzymatic regulation. Moreover, detailed

	Abstract = {Quantitative computational models play an increasingly important role
	in modern biology. Such models typically involve many free parameters,
	and assigning their values is often a substantial obstacle to model
	development. Directly measuring in vivo biochemical parameters is
	difficult, and collectively fitting them to other experimental data
	often yields large parameter uncertainties. Nevertheless, in earlier
	work we showed in a growth-factor-signaling model that collective
	fitting could yield well-constrained predictions, even when it left
	individual parameters very poorly constrained. We also showed that
	the model had a "sloppy" spectrum of parameter sensitivities, with
	eigenvalues roughly evenly distributed over many decades. Here we
	use a collection of models from the literature to test whether such
	sloppy spectra are common in systems biology. Strikingly, we find
	that every model we examine has a sloppy spectrum of sensitivities.
	We also test several consequences of this sloppiness for building
	predictive models. In particular, sloppiness suggests that collective
	fits to even large amounts of ideal time-series data will often leave
	many parameters poorly constrained. Tests over our model collection
	are consistent with this suggestion. This difficulty with collective
	fits may seem to argue for direct parameter measurements, but sloppiness
	also implies that such measurements must be formidably precise and
	complete to usefully constrain many model predictions. We confirm
	this implication in our growth-factor-signaling model. Our results
	suggest that sloppy sensitivity spectra are universal in systems
	biology models. The prevalence of sloppiness highlights the power
	of collective fits and suggests that modelers should focus on predictions
	rather than on parameters.},

	Abstract = {Epithelium is the tissue phenotype of early embryos and primitive
	adults of the chordate phylum. A second tissue type, however, is
	produced by epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT) in higher
	chordates, such as vertebrata. Mesenchymal cells have the ability,
	which true epithelia do not, to invade and migrate through the extracellular
	matrix (ECM) to create dramatic cell transpositions. The first-formed
	or primary mesenchymal cells in amniote vertebrates migrate from
	the primitive streak to differentiate into the mesodermal and endodermal
	epithelia. Definitive mesenchyme with connective tissue and muscle
	potentials arises from the epithelial mesoderm at about the same
	time as the neural crest mesenchyme forms from the ectoderm. Later
	on in embryogenesis. EMT is used to remodel unwanted epithelia, such
	as that of the palate medial edges. We discuss the mechanisms by
	which epithelial cells transform into mesenchyme and vice versa.
	On the one hand, cells activate putative mesenchymal master genes,
	turn off epithelial genes, and acquire motility machinery that allows
	them to interact in 3 dimensions (3D) with ECM via actin cortex while
	sliding their endoplasm into their new front ends. On the other hand,
	primary mesenchymal cells can reactivate epithelial regulatory genes,
	such as E-cadherin, turn off the motility machinery for invading
	ECM, and reexpress apical-basal polarity. We review the genes, such
	as FSP1, src, ras, and fos, that are activated in cells transforming
	to mesenchyme and the genes their neighbors activate to induce EMT,
	such as those for TGF beta, NT-3, and sonic hedgehog. Suspension
	in 3D collagen gels can induce adult epithelium to undergo EMT; alpha
	5 beta 1 integrin is activated on surfaces in contact with collagen,
	including apical surfaces that do not normally express integrins.
	In vivo, it is possible that pathological manipulations of a cell's
	environment likewise induce EMT. Of the examples we give, the creation
	of invasive metastatic carcinoma cells by EMT is the most fearful.
	Interestingly, transfection of either metastatic cells or normal
	embryonic fibroblasts with the E-cadherin gene converts them to the
	epithelial phenotype. It may be possible in the future to manipulate
	the tissue phenotype of diseased cells to the advantage of the animal.},

	Abstract = {The type III transforming growth factor-beta receptor (TbetaRIII or
	betaglycan) is a ubiquitously expressed transforming growth factor-beta
	(TGF-beta) superfamily coreceptor with essential roles in embryonic
	development. Recent studies have defined a role for TbetaRIII in
	the pathogenesis of human cancers, with frequent loss of TbetaRIII
	expression at the message and protein level. Mechanisms for the loss
	of TbetaRIII expression remain to be fully defined. Advanced human
	cancers often have elevated circulating levels of TGF-beta1. Here,
	we define a specific role for TGF-beta1 in negatively regulating
	TbetaRIII at the message level in breast and ovarian cancer models.
	TGF-beta1 decreased TbetaRIII message and protein levels in ovarian
	(Ovca420) and breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) cell lines in both a dose-
	and time-dependent manner. TGF-beta1-mediated TbetaRIII repression
	is mediated by the type I TGF-beta receptor/Smad2/3 pathway as the
	activin receptor-like kinase 5 (ALK5) inhibitor, SB431542, abrogated
	this effect, while the expression of constitutively active ALK5 was
	sufficient to repress TbetaRIII expression. Mechanistically, TGF-beta1
	does not affect TbetaRIII messenger RNA (mRNA) stability, but instead
	directly regulates the TbetaRIII promoter. We define alternative
	promoters for the TGFBR3 gene, a distal and proximal promoter. Although
	both promoters are active, only the proximal promoter was responsive
	and negatively regulated by TGF-beta1 and constitutively active ALK5.
	Taken together, these studies define TGF-beta1-mediated downregulation
	of TbetaRIII mRNA expression through effects on the ALK5/Smad2/3
	pathway on the TGFBR3 gene proximal promoter as a potential mechanism
	for decreased TbetaRIII expression in human cancers.},

	normal ovarian function. Betaglycan, or the type III TGF-beta receptor,
	is a coreceptor that regulates TGF-beta, activin, and inhibin signaling.
	Here, we show that betaglycan expression is frequently decreased
	or lost in epithelial derived ovarian cancer at both the mRNA and
	protein level, with the degree of loss correlating with tumor grade.
	Treatment of ovarian cancer cell lines with the methyltransferase
	inhibitor 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine and the histone deacetylase inhibitor
	trichostatin A resulted in significant synergistic induction of betaglycan
	message levels and increased betaglycan protein expression, indicating

	expression observed in ovarian cancer. Although restoring betaglycan
	expression in Ovca429 ovarian cancer cells is not sufficient to restore
	TGF-beta-mediated inhibition of proliferation, betaglycan significantly
	inhibits ovarian cancer cell motility and invasiveness. Furthermore,
	betaglycan specifically enhances the antimigratory effects of inhibin

	Abstract = {Transition from a sessile epithelial phenotype to a migrating mesenchymal
	phenotype is a crucial step in transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)-induced
	pancreatic cancer cell migration and invasion. These profound morphologic
	and functional alterations are associated with characteristic changes
	in TGF-beta-regulated gene expression, defined by rapid repression
	of epithelial markers and a strong and sustained transcriptional
	induction of mesenchymal markers such as the intermediate filament
	vimentin. In this study, we have analyzed the role of the transcription
	factor Sp1 in TGF-beta-induced and Smad-mediated gene regulation
	during epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and migration of
	pancreatic cancer cells. Here, we show that Sp1 is required for TGF-beta-induced
	EMT, and that this function is especially mediated through transcriptional
	induction of vimentin. Our results emphasize the functional relevance
	of vimentin in TGF-beta-induced EMT because prevention of its induction
	strongly reduces cell migration. Altogether, this study helps to
	better understand the role of Sp1 in TGF-beta-induced progression
	of pancreatic cancer. It suggests that Sp1, via transcriptional induction
	of vimentin, cooperates with activated Smad complexes in mesenchymal
	transition and migration of pancreatic cancer cells upon TGF-beta
	stimulation.},

	Abstract = {Platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB) induced cyclin A expression
	and CDK2 activity in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). Inhibition
	of nuclear factors of activated T cell (NFAT) activation by cyclosporin
	A (CsA) and VIVIT suppressed PDGF-BB-induced cyclin A expression
	and CDK2 activity, resulting in blockade of VSMC in the G(1) phase.
	In addition, CsA- and VIVIT-mediated inhibition of NFATs and small
	interfering RNA-targeted down-regulation of cyclin A levels suppressed
	PDGF-BB-induced VSMC DNA synthesis. PDGF-BB also induced cyclin A
	mRNA levels in VSMC in an NFAT-dependent manner. Cloning and bioinformatic
	analysis of rat cyclin A promoter revealed the presence of NFAT-binding
	elements, and PDGF-BB induced the binding of NFATs to these regulatory
	sequences in a CsA- and VIVIT-sensitive manner. Chromatin immunoprecipitation
	analysis showed that NFATc1 binds to the cyclin A promoter in response
	to PDGF-BB in a VIVIT-sensitive manner. Furthermore, PDGF-BB induced
	cyclin A promoter-luciferase reporter gene activity in VSMC, and
	it was inhibited by both CsA and VIVIT. Balloon injury induced cyclin
	A expression and CDK2 activity in rat carotid arteries, and these
	responses were also blocked by VIVIT. In addition, VIVIT attenuated
	balloon injury-induced SMC proliferation, resulting in reduced restenosis.
	Down-regulation of NFATc1 by its small interfering RNA inhibited
	PDGF-BB-induced cyclin A expression and DNA synthesis both in rat
	and human VSMC. Together, these findings demonstrate that the cyclin
	A-CDK2 complex may be a potential effector of NFATs, specifically
	NFATc1, in mediating SMC multiplication leading to neointima formation.
	Therefore, NFATs may be used as target molecules for the development
	of therapeutic agents against vascular diseases such as restenosis.},

	Abstract = {There are ten mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatases
	(MKPs) that act as negative regulators of MAPK activity in mammalian
	cells and these can be subdivided into three groups. The first comprises
	DUSP1/MKP-1, DUSP2/PAC1, DUSP4/MKP-2 and DUSP5/hVH-3, which are inducible
	nuclear phosphatases. With the exception of DUSP5, these MKPs display
	a rather broad specificity for inactivation of the ERK, p38 and JNK
	MAP kinases. The second group contains three closely related ERK-specific
	and cytoplasmic MKPs encoded by DUSP6/MKP-3, DUSP7/MKP-X and DUSP9/MKP-4.
	The final group consists of three MKPs DUSP8/hVH-5, DUSP10/MKP-5
	and DUSP16/MKP-7 all of which preferentially inactivate the stress-activated
	p38 and JNK MAP kinases. Abnormal MAPK signalling will have important
	consequences for processes critical to the development and progression
	of human cancer. In addition, MAPK signalling also plays a key role
	in determining the response of tumour cells to conventional cancer
	therapies. The emerging roles of the dual-specificity MKPs in the

	in development that is characterized by loss of E-cadherin, beta-catenin
	relocalization, and acquisition of elongated cell shape and ability
	to invade ECM. beta-catenin has been shown to activate LEF-1 transcription
	during EMT induced in vitro by c-Fos. Here, we ask whether or not
	LEF-1 directly introduced into epithelial cells in an adenovirus
	construct can induce EMT. In normal epithelial cell lines, such as
	HCE and MDCK cells, that contain functional APC, nuclear beta-catenin
	induced by exogenous LEF-1 is rapidly exported and EMT is not induced.
	Leptomycin-B blocks beta-catenin nuclear export, but no EMT occurs
	due to toxicity. Addition of Wnt-1 to normal epithelial cell lines
	stabilizes cytoplasmic beta-catenin that LEF-1 then transports to
	nuclei, causing a small amount of EMT. Our experiments demonstrated,
	however, that overexpressed LEF-1 upregulates nuclear beta-catenin
	and promotes dramatic EMT in DLD-1 epithelial tumors that retain
	nuclear beta-catenin. This EMT is reversible if the LEF-1 virus is
	removed. Thus, our results demonstrate that LEF-1 can induce EMT
	directly when its transcription activity is activated by stable nuclear
	beta-catenin. Normal adult epithelial cells appear to use APC to
	keep beta-catenin out of the nucleus, thereby avoiding pathologies
	such as metastases due to LEF/beta-catenin-induced EMT.},

	responses. Here we report that oncogenic Ras inhibits TGFbeta signaling
	in mammary and lung epithelial cells by negatively regulating the
	TGFbeta mediators Smad2 and Smad3. Oncogenically activated Ras inhibits
	the TGFbeta-induced nuclear accumulation of Smad2 and Smad3 and Smad-dependent
	transcription. Ras acting via Erk MAP kinases causes phosphorylation
	of Smad2 and Smad3 at specific sites in the region linking the DNA-binding
	domain and the transcriptional activation domain. These sites are
	separate from the TGFbeta receptor phosphorylation sites that activate
	Smad nuclear translocation. Mutation of these MAP kinase sites in
	Smad3 yields a Ras-resistant form that can rescue the growth inhibitory
	response to TGFbeta in Ras-transformed cells. EGF, which is weaker
	than oncogenic mutations at activating Ras, induces a less extensive
	phosphorylation and cytoplasmic retention of Smad2 and Smad3. Our
	results suggest a mechanism for the counterbalanced regulation of

	In this study we evaluated the expression of betaglycan during the
	C(2)C(12) skeletal muscle differentiation. Betaglycan expression,
	as determined by Northern and Western blot, was up-regulated during
	the conversion of myoblasts to myotubes. The mouse betaglycan gene
	promoter was cloned, and its sequence showed putative binding sites
	for SP1, Smad3, Smad4, muscle regulatory factor elements such as
	MyoD and MEF2, and retinoic acid receptor. Transcriptional activity
	of the mouse betaglycan promoter reporter was also up-regulated in
	differentiating C(2)C(12) cells. We found that MyoD, but not myogenin,
	stimulated this transcriptional activity even in the presence of
	high serum. Betaglycan promoter activity was increased by RA and
	inhibited by the three isoforms of TGF-beta. On the other hand, basic
	fibroblast growth factor, BMP-2, and hepatocyte growth factor/scatter
	factor, which are inhibitors of myogenesis, had little effect. In
	myotubes, up-regulated betaglycan was also detectable by TGF-beta
	affinity labeling and immunofluorescence microscopy studies. The
	latter indicated that betaglycan was localized both on the cell surface

	gene networks, yet understanding how to integrate multiple synthetic
	modules and interface them with endogenous pathways remains a challenge.
	Here we present the design, system integration, and analysis of several
	large scale synthetic gene circuits for artificial tissue homeostasis.
	Diabetes therapy represents a possible application for engineered
	homeostasis, where genetically programmed stem cells maintain a steady
	population of β-cells despite continuous turnover. We develop a
	new iterative process that incorporates modular design principles
	with hierarchical performance optimization targeted for environments
	with uncertainty and incomplete information. We employ theoretical
	analysis and computational simulations of multicellular reaction/diffusion
	models to design and understand system behavior, and find that certain
	features often associated with robustness (e.g., multicellular synchronization
	and noise attenuation) are actually detrimental for tissue homeostasis.
	We overcome these problems by engineering a new class of genetic
	modules for 'synthetic cellular heterogeneity' that function to generate
	beneficial population diversity. We design two such modules (an asynchronous
	genetic oscillator and a signaling throttle mechanism), demonstrate
	their capacity for enhancing robust control, and provide guidance
	for experimental implementation with various computational techniques.
	We found that designing modules for synthetic heterogeneity can be
	complex, and in general requires a framework for non-linear and multifactorial
	analysis. Consequently, we adapt a 'phenotypic sensitivity analysis'
	method to determine how functional module behaviors combine to achieve
	optimal system performance. We ultimately combine this analysis with
	Bayesian network inference to extract critical, causal relationships
	between a module's biochemical rate-constants, its high level functional
	behavior in isolation, and its impact on overall system performance

	Abstract = {Beta-catenin signaling has been shown to be involved in triggering
	axis formation in several organisms, including Xenopus and zebrafish.
	Genetic analysis has demonstrated that the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling
	pathway is also involved in axis formation in the mouse, since a
	targeted deletion of beta-catenin results in embryos that have a
	block in anterior-posterior axis formation, fail to initiate gastrulation,
	and do not form mesoderm. However, because beta-catenin is ubiquitously
	expressed, the precise time and cell types in which this signaling
	pathway is active during early embryonic development remain unknown.
	Thus, to better understand the role of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling
	pathway in axis formation and mesoderm specification, we have examined
	both the distribution and signaling activity of beta-catenin during
	early embryonic development in the mouse. We show that the N-terminally
	nonphosphorylated form of beta-catenin as well as beta-catenin signaling
	is first detectable in the extraembryonic visceral endoderm in day
	5.5 embryos. Before the initiation of gastrulation at day 6.0, beta-catenin
	signaling is asymmetrically distributed within the epiblast and is
	localized to a small group of cells adjacent to the embryonic--extraembryonic
	junction. At day 6.5 and onward, beta-catenin signaling was detected
	in the primitive streak and mature node. Thus, beta-catenin signaling
	precedes primitive streak formation and is present in epiblast cells
	that will go on to form the primitive streak. These results support
	a critical role for the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in specifying cells
	to form the primitive streak and node in the mammalian embryo as
	well as identify a novel domain of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling activity
	during early embryogenesis.},

	factor and the cell adhesion molecule beta-catenin. However, more
	recent studies have implicated a significant role of the transforming
	growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) in causing EMT in both development
	and pathology. The ability of TGF-beta isoforms to signal through
	a variety of molecules such as Smads, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
	(PI3K), and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) creates an incredible
	complexity as to their role in this transition. Here we assess the

	Abstract = {Dissociation of medial-edge epithelium (MEE) during palate development
	is essential for mediating correct craniofacial morphogenesis. This
	phenomenon is initiated by TGFbeta3 upon adherence of opposing palatal
	shelves, because loss of E-cadherin causes the MEE seam to break
	into small epithelial islands. To investigate the molecular mechanisms
	that cause this E-cadherin loss, we isolated and cultured murine
	embryonic primary MEE cells from adhered or non-adhered palates.
	Here, we provide the first evidence that lymphoid enhancer factor
	1 (LEF1), when functionally activated by phosphorylated Smad2 (Smad2-P)
	and Smad4 (rather than beta-catenin), binds with the promoter of
	the E-cadherin gene to repress its transcription in response to TGFbeta3
	signaling. Furthermore, we found that TGFbeta3 signaling stimulates
	epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT) and cell migration in
	these cells. LEF1 and Smad4 were found to be necessary for up-regulation
	of the mesenchymal markers vimentin and fibronectin, independently
	of beta-catenin. We proved that TGFbeta3 signaling induces EMT in
	MEE cells by forming activated transcription complexes of Smad2-P,
	Smad4 and LEF1 that directly inhibit E-cadherin gene expression.},

	Abstract = {In recent times, stochastic treatments of gene regulatory processes
	have appeared in the literature in which a cell exposed to a signaling
	molecule in its environment triggers the synthesis of a specific
	protein through a network of intracellular reactions. The stochastic
	nature of this process leads to a distribution of protein levels
	in a population of cells as determined by a Fokker-Planck equation.
	Often instability occurs as a consequence of two (stable) steady
	state protein levels, one at the low end representing the "off" state,
	and the other at the high end representing the "on" state for a given
	concentration of the signaling molecule within a suitable range.
	A consequence of such bistability has been the appearance of bimodal
	distributions indicating two different populations, one in the "off"
	state and the other in the "on" state. The bimodal distribution can
	come about from stochastic analysis of a single cell. However, the
	concerted action of the population altering the extracellular concentration
	in the environment of individual cells and hence their behavior can
	only be accomplished by an appropriate population balance model which
	accounts for the reciprocal effects of interaction between the population
	and its environment. In this study, we show how to formulate a population
	balance model in which stochastic gene expression in individual cells
	is incorporated. Interestingly, the simulation of the model shows
	that bistability is neither sufficient nor necessary for bimodal
	distributions in a population. The original notion of linking bistability
	with bimodal distribution from single cell stochastic model is therefore
	only a special consequence of a population balance model.},

	Abstract = {Intracellular calcium dynamics are critical to cellular functions

	in modulating intracellular calcium levels by interacting with the
	P2 family of surface receptors. In this study, we developed a mechanistic
	mathematical model of ATP-induced P2 mediated calcium signaling in
	archetype sensory neurons. The model architecture, which described
	90 species connected by 162 interactions, was formulated by aggregating
	disparate molecular modules from literature. Unlike previous models,
	only mass action kinetics were used to describe the rate of molecular
	interactions. Thus, the majority of the 252 unknown model parameters
	were either association, dissociation or catalytic rate constants.
	Model parameters were estimated from nine independent data sets taken
	from multiple laboratories. The training data consisted of both dynamic
	and steady-state measurements. However, because of the complexity
	of the calcium network, we were unable to estimate unique model parameters.
	Instead, we estimated a family or ensemble of probable parameter
	sets using a multi-objective thermal ensemble method. Each member
	of the ensemble met an error criterion and was located along or near
	the optimal trade-off surface between the individual training data
	sets. The model quantitatively reproduced experimental measurements
	from dorsal root ganglion neurons as a function of extracellular

	with P2X receptor activity explained the inhibition of P2X-mediated
	current flow by activated metabotropic P2Y receptors. Sensitivity
	analysis using individual and the whole system outputs suggested
	which molecular subsystems were most important following P2 activation.
	Taken together, modeling and analysis of ATP-induced P2 mediated

	In this study, we constructed and analyzed a mathematical model of
	the integration between hormone growth factor signaling, androgen
	receptor activation, and the expression of cyclin D and Prostate-Specific
	Antigen in human LNCaP prostate adenocarcinoma cells. The objective
	of the study was to investigate which signaling systems were important
	in the loss of androgen dependence. The model was formulated as a
	set of ordinary differential equations which described 212 species
	and 384 interactions, including both the mRNA and protein levels
	for key species. An ensemble approach was chosen to constrain model
	parameters and to estimate the impact of parametric uncertainty on
	model predictions. Model parameters were identified using 14 steady-state
	and dynamic LNCaP data sets taken from literature sources. Alterations
	in the rate of Prostatic Acid Phosphatase expression was sufficient
	to capture varying levels of androgen dependence. Analysis of the
	model provided insight into the importance of network components

	receptor availability and the MAPK/Akt signaling axes was independent
	of androgen status. Interestingly, androgen receptor availability
	was important even in androgen-independent LNCaP cells. Translation
	became progressively more important in androgen-independent LNCaP
	cells. Further analysis suggested a positive synergy between the
	MAPK and Akt signaling axes and the translation of key proliferative

	this study, we integrated computational and experimental methods
	to unravel the response of a lineage uncommitted precursor cell-line,
	{HL}-60, to {R}etinoic {A}cid ({RA}). {HL}-60 is a human myeloblastic
	leukemia cell-line used extensively to study human differentiation
	programs. {I}nitially, we focused on the role of the {BLR}1 receptor
	in {RA}-induced differentiation and {G}1/0-arrest in {HL}-60. {BLR}1,
	a putative {G} protein-coupled receptor expressed following {RA}
	exposure, is required for {RA}-induced cell-cycle arrest and differentiation
	and causes persistent {MAPK} signaling. {A} mathematical model of
	{RA}-induced cell-cycle arrest and differentiation was formulated
	and tested against {BLR}1 wild-type (wt) knock-out and knock-in {HL}-60
	cell-lines with and without {RA}. {T}he current model described the
	dynamics of 729 proteins and protein complexes interconnected by
	1356 interactions. {A}n ensemble strategy was used to compensate
	for uncertain model parameters. {T}he ensemble of {HL}-60 models
	recapitulated the positive feedback between {BLR}1 and {MAPK} signaling.
	{T}he ensemble of models also correctly predicted {R}b and p47phox
	regulation and the correlation between p21-{CDK}4-cyclin {D} formation
	and {G}1/0-arrest following exposure to {RA}. {F}inally, we investigated
	the robustness of the {HL}-60 network architecture to structural
	perturbations and generated experimentally testable hypotheses for
	future study. {T}aken together, the model presented here was a first
	step toward a systematic framework for analysis of programmed differentiation.
	{T}hese studies also demonstrated that mechanistic network modeling
	can help prioritize experimental directions by generating falsifiable
	hypotheses despite uncertainty.},

	Abstract = {The capability to gather organism wide data has far outstripped the
	ability to understand it. Transforming large-scale data into a "better"
	cell requires tools that integrate physiology with its environment.
	One such tool is large-scale mathematical models that marry stoichiometry
	and kinetics with metabolic regulation and control. It is straightforward
	to determine stoichiometry (at least for central pathways), and kinetics
	can be roughly approximated where need be. However, the molecular
	details of the "metabolic wiring" managing the cell are often missing.
	Presented here is a surrogate for these missing details based on
	a simple premise; over evolutionary time, biological systems have
	developed objective-based programs that frugally manage gene expression
	and enzyme activity. Mathematically, this notion can be represented
	as sets of nonlinear control or "management" problems which, when
	solved in parallel with the model balances, offer a prediction of
	how gene expression and enzyme activity are modulated, in the absence
	of specific mechanistic details. We present a model of Escherichia
	coli central carbon metabolism, describing batch aerobic growth on
	glucose, in which transcription, translation, and activity of the
	gene products of 45 genes is "managed" using this approach. The model
	consists of 122 species (metabolites, enzymes, mRNA pools, and biomass)
	and describes 46 reactions (17 reversible). The model is identified
	(kinetic parameters as well as management structure) from metabolic
	flux ratio (METAFoR) analysis and physiological measurements. Simulations
	of a pyruvate kinase knockout strain are compared with experiments
	and it is shown the model is capable of accurately capturing the
	metabolic reprogramming resulting from the deletion. Analysis of
	the mRNA expression pattern, translational pattern and enzyme activity
	pattern of the wild-type versus mutant indicates a combination of
	expression and specific activity shifts are responsible for observed
	differences. While being only a first step toward large-scale physiological
	modeling, this work is important in two ways. First, it strengthens
	the hypothesis that unknown mechanism can be reasonably approximated
	using objective-based management criteria. Second, it provides a
	dynamic means to couple large-scale analysis technologies with physiology

	Recently, it was demonstrated that transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta

	Abstract = {G-protein-coupled receptor 54 (Gpr54, KISS1 receptor) plays critical
	roles in puberty regulation, tumor metastasis suppression, and vasoconstriction.
	Bone morphogenetic protein-7 (Bmp7) is required for kidney organogenesis.
	However, whether Gpr54 is involved in embryonic kidney development
	and how Bmp7 expression is regulated in the kidney are largely unknown.
	Here we report that Gpr54 deletion leads to kidney branching morphogenesis
	and glomerular development retardation in embryonic kidneys in vivo
	and in explanted kidneys in vitro. Gpr54 inactivation results in
	a high risk of low glomerular number in adult kidneys. Gpr54 is expressed
	in condensed mesenchyme at E12.5 and epithelial cells of proximal
	and distal tubules and collecting ducts at E17.5 and P0 mouse kidney.
	Deletion of Gpr54 decreases Bmp7 expression and Smad1 phosphorylation
	in the developing kidney. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation and
	luciferase assays, we demonstrate that Gpr54 regulates NFAT2- and
	Sp1-mediated Bmp7 transcription. Furthermore, we show that NFAT2
	cooperates with Sp1 to promote Bmp7 transcription activation. Together,
	these data suggest that Gpr54 regulates Bmp7 expression through NFAT2
	and Sp1 and plays an important role in embryonic kidney branching
	morphogenesis and glomerular development.},

	Differences in gene expression between weakly and highly invasive

	on a matrix of basement membrane constituents (i.e., Matrigel). We
	found that the expression of keratin 19 was consistently elevated

	antigen-1 (FRA-1) were consistently overexpressed in the more highly
	aggressive BC cells. Moreover, even without these three genes, the

	to emerging epithelium of the nephron via mesenchymal to epithelial
	transition (MET). In the injured adult kidney, renal epithelia contribute
	to the generation of fibroblasts via epithelial-mesenchymal transition,
	facilitating renal fibrosis. Recombinant human bone morphogenic protein
	(BMP)-7, a morphogen that is essential for the conversion of epithelia
	from condensing mesenchyme during kidney development, enhances the
	repair of tubular structures in the kidney. In this setting, BMP-7
	inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal transition involving adult renal
	epithelial tubular cells and decreases secretion of type I collagen
	by adult renal fibroblasts. In search of a mechanism behind the ability
	of BMP-7 to repair damaged renal tubules, we hypothesized that systemic
	treatment with BMP-7 might induce MET involving adult renal fibroblasts
	in the injured kidney, generating functional epithelial cells. Here
	we report that BMP-7 induces formation of epithelial cell aggregates
	in adult renal fibroblasts associated with reacquisition of E-cadherin
	expression and decreased motility, mimicking the effect of BMP-7
	on embryonic metanephric mesenchyme to generate epithelium. In addition,

	associated with MET involving adult renal interstitial fibroblasts
	in mouse models for renal fibrosis. Collectively, these findings
	suggest that adult renal fibroblasts might retain parts of their

	receptor expression in the rat intestinal epithelial cell line IEC-18
	(J. Filmus, J. Zhao, and R. N. Buick, Oncogene, 7: 521-526, 1992).
	Here, we investigate the possible mechanisms involved in H-ras-mediated
	regulation of TGF-beta receptors in an IEC-18 cell clone expressing
	H-ras, conditional on the activity of a dexamethasone-sensitive promoter.
	The switch from type II to type I receptor expression in response
	to H-ras expression has a requirement for de novo RNA synthesis.
	In addition, accumulation of TGF-beta receptor type II mRNA is approximately
	5-fold lower in ras-expressing cells compared to control cells. Nuclear
	run-on experiments suggest that the down-regulation of type II receptor
	mRNA by H-ras oncogene is based, at least in part, on reduced transcription.
	We have also analyzed the consequences of H-ras expression on the
	properties of the TGF-beta receptors. Type I and II in IEC-18 cells
	and type I receptors in ras-transformed cells have similar characteristics
	in terms of binding affinities for TGF-beta 1 (or TGF-beta 2) turnover
	rates and glycosylation states. Notably, the type I receptors in
	ras-transformed cells are not capable of ligand-induced internalization.
	Although H-ras expression in IEC-18 cells causes resistance to TGF-beta-mediated
	growth inhibition, the cells remain responsive to TGF-beta 1 stimulation
